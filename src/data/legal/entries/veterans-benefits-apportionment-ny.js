  title: { en: "VA Benefits Apportionment — When a Spouse or Child Can Claim a Share of a Veteran's Disability or Pension" },

  summary: {
    en: "A spouse, former spouse, or child of a veteran who receives VA disability compensation or pension can request an apportionment — a share of the benefits paid directly to the dependent. This is different from garnishment. Apportionment is ordered by the VA under 38 CFR Section 3.450 and following sections when the veteran is not providing reasonable support. Claims are filed with the VA regional office, not through family court."

      "A former spouse with a qualifying child.",

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "VA benefits are not subject to normal state-court garnishment for child or spousal support; federal law at 38 USC Section 5301 generally exempts them from assignment or attachment. The VA's own apportionment process under 38 CFR Sections 3.450 through 3.461 is the primary route for dependents to receive a direct share. Two categories of apportionment: General apportionment under 38 CFR 3.450 is available when the veteran is not residing with the spouse or child and is not reasonably discharging responsibility for their support. No finding of hardship is required — only that the veteran is not providing reasonable support. Special apportionment under 38 CFR 3.451 is available even when the veteran is providing some support, if the dependent shows hardship. The apportionment cannot cause undue hardship to the veteran. Filing: the dependent files a claim with the VA Regional Office (VA Form 21-0788) with supporting documents — marriage or divorce decree, birth certificate of children, proof of custody, income statements, and any child or spousal support order. The VA notifies the veteran and allows 60 days for response. The VA then decides the apportionment percentage based on the needs of the dependents and the income of the veteran. Typical apportionment ranges from 20 to 50 percent of the veteran's monthly benefit. The apportionment is paid directly to the dependent. Appeals: both veteran and dependent can appeal the VA's apportionment decision through the Board of Veterans' Appeals process. Family court orders: while state family court cannot order the VA to pay a dependent directly, state courts can consider the veteran's VA benefits in setting overall support obligations and can order the veteran to pay child support from those funds. If the veteran does not pay, apportionment through the VA is the enforcement mechanism. Military retirement pay (different from VA disability) IS subject to Uniformed Services Former Spouses Protection Act division and can be garnished for support."

  example: {
    en: "A Rochester mother of two had been separated from her veteran husband for two years. He received $3,200 monthly in VA disability compensation but paid no support. She contacted the Monroe County Veterans Service Agency, which helped her file VA Form 21-0788 with proof of marriage, the children's birth certificates, and a statement of her income and expenses. The VA notified her husband and, after his response, granted a 40 percent apportionment — approximately $1,280 monthly paid directly to her. She also filed for family court child support, which resulted in an order covering the apportionment amount and additional support from the veteran's other income."
