  summary: {
    en: "A tenant's right to change the locks depends on the lease and the situation. In New York, tenants generally have the right to install additional security devices (like a chain lock or deadbolt) at their own expense, and the landlord cannot charge a fee for this. For domestic violence survivors, New York law provides the explicit right to change locks with proper notice to the landlord."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Lock and security are often the first real test of a landlord-tenant relationship. New York law gives tenants several distinct rights around locks: the right to functioning locks, the right to add security at the tenant's own expense, and specific stronger rights for domestic violence survivors.\n\nThe baseline — warranty of habitability. Real Property Law 235-b is New York's implied warranty of habitability. It applies to every residential lease regardless of what the lease says. The landlord has to provide functioning locks on all entry doors. A broken lock is a habitability issue the landlord has to repair or replace within a reasonable time — typically days, not weeks, especially when the property is occupied.\n\nTenant's right to add security. Real Property Law 235-e, along with local codes in many NY municipalities (including NYC Administrative Code 27-2004(8)), gives tenants the right to install additional locks and security devices at the tenant's own expense. The landlord cannot prevent the tenant from adding a chain lock, a deadbolt, or a security camera on the door, and the landlord cannot charge a fee for permission. A lease clause saying 'no additional locks without prior written consent' is generally unenforceable for these basic security additions.\n\nKey-sharing rule. When a tenant installs an additional lock, the tenant has to provide the landlord with a key. This is standard in most leases and local codes. The rule exists so the landlord retains emergency access (for example, for fire response, a burst pipe, or an eviction judgment). A tenant who refuses to provide a key to a new lock is violating the lease and can be sued.\n\nLandlord locks the tenant out. A landlord who changes the locks to keep a tenant out of the unit — without a court order — is committing an illegal eviction under Real Property Law 235-a and can be charged with the crime of unlawful eviction under RPAPL 768. Only a sheriff, marshal, or constable with a court warrant can remove a tenant. Self-help eviction (lock changes, removing doors, shutting off utilities) is always illegal in New York.\n\nDomestic violence survivors — stronger rights. Real Property Law 227-d provides explicit protections for survivors. A tenant who has an order of protection or a police report documenting domestic violence may request that the landlord change the locks. The landlord has to comply within a reasonable time. If the landlord does not, the tenant can change the locks themselves and provide the landlord with a key to the new lock.\n\nLease clauses that conflict with RPL 227-d. A lease provision prohibiting lock changes is not enforceable against a tenant in a domestic violence situation. RPL 227-d overrides the lease. The tenant does not need to ask the landlord's permission to change the locks under 227-d; the tenant only needs to provide the landlord with the new key.\n\nWhen the alleged abuser is on the lease. If the alleged abuser is also a tenant on the same lease, the situation is more complex. RPL 227-c and 227-d together give the victim mechanisms to terminate the lease early or force a lease amendment. An attorney or domestic violence advocate can help navigate the specific situation.\n\nEnforcement paths. A tenant whose landlord refuses to repair a broken lock can file a code enforcement complaint with Rochester 311 or the local building department. A retaliation claim under RPL 223-b applies if the landlord harasses the tenant for adding security or requesting a lock change.

  example: {
    en: "A tenant in Rochester obtains an order of protection against a former partner who also lived in the apartment. The former partner still has a key. The tenant requests that the landlord change the locks, providing a copy of the order of protection. The landlord delays for two weeks. The tenant, citing RPL § 227-d, changes the lock herself, installs a new deadbolt, and provides the landlord with a key to the new lock. The cost is modest and the tenant is now safe."
