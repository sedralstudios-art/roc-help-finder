  title: { en: "Tenant Screening and Blacklists — What Landlords Can and Cannot Use Against You in New York" },

  summary: {
    en: "Many tenants are denied housing because their name appears in a tenant screening report — often based on a past eviction case that was dismissed, an old debt, or even a case filed against a different person with a similar name. New York passed landmark tenant screening reforms in 2019 that limit what landlords can consider and give tenants the right to see and dispute the report."

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Any person who has been denied a rental based on a tenant screening or background report.",
      "Any person who suspects their name is on a 'tenant blacklist' because of a past housing court case — even one that was dismissed or settled.",
      "Any person who has been asked to pay excessive application fees."
    ]
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Tenant screening companies compile reports on prospective tenants using court records, credit reports, and eviction histories. Before the 2019 HSTPA reforms, these reports often included cases that were dismissed, cases where the tenant won, and cases that were sealed — creating a 'blacklist' effect that punished tenants for exercising their legal rights. Under the 2019 reforms and CPLR § 213-b, housing court records that resulted in a favorable outcome for the tenant (dismissal, withdrawal, settlement with no finding of liability) are sealed and cannot be reported by screening companies. Landlords in New York are also limited in what application fees they can charge — the total fee for a background check and credit check is capped (check the current cap at hcr.ny.gov, as the amount is set by regulation and can change). The landlord must provide a copy of any screening report used to deny the application if the tenant requests it. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, if a tenant is denied based on a screening report, the landlord must provide an adverse action notice identifying the screening company, and the tenant has the right to dispute inaccurate information with that company."

  example: {
    en: "A tenant in Rochester was taken to housing court by a previous landlord over a rent dispute. The case was dismissed after the tenant proved the rent was paid. Two years later, she applies for a new apartment and is denied. She requests the screening report and finds the dismissed case listed as an 'eviction filing.' She disputes it with the screening company, citing the 2019 sealing law. The company removes it within three weeks. She reapplies and is approved."
