  summary: {
    en: "When a bank account is frozen, the account holder cannot withdraw money, write checks, or use the debit card. A freeze usually happens because a creditor obtained a court judgment and served a restraining notice on the bank. But certain income — like Social Security, SSI, veterans benefits, and public assistance — is protected from being frozen."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Under CPLR Article 52, a creditor who wins a money judgment in court can serve a restraining notice on the debtor's bank. The bank must freeze the account immediately. The creditor then has up to one year to serve a property execution to actually take the money. Under federal and state law, certain funds are exempt from being frozen or taken. Social Security, SSI, veterans benefits, public assistance, child support received, workers' compensation, and unemployment benefits are all protected. Under the federal rule (31 CFR Part 212), if the bank can see that the last two months of deposits include protected benefits through direct deposit, the bank must automatically protect up to two months' worth of those deposits and keep them available to the account holder — even if the rest of the account is frozen. If the bank froze exempt funds, the account holder can file an exemption claim to get them released. The debtor has the right to challenge the freeze entirely if the underlying judgment is wrong."

      "The debtor has the right to challenge the underlying judgment if they were never properly served with the lawsuit.",
      "A judgment creditor cannot freeze an account without first winning a court case — if no judgment exists, the freeze is illegal."

  example: {
    en: "When Donna checked her bank balance, it was zero — her entire $2,800 was frozen. She had never been served with a lawsuit, but a debt collector had obtained a default judgment and served a restraining notice on her bank. Donna called Legal Aid, which found that $1,900 of the frozen money was her monthly Social Security deposit. Legal Aid filed an exemption claim and a motion to vacate the default judgment. The court released the $1,900 in exempt funds within a week. The motion to vacate was granted because Donna was never properly served with the original lawsuit."
