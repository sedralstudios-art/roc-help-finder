  summary: {
    en: "Under the Sixth Amendment and NY County Law Article 18-B (section 722 of the County Law), a person charged with a crime or facing certain Family Court proceedings who cannot afford private counsel has the right to a court-assigned attorney at no cost. In Monroe County, the Public Defender handles most cases, and the 18-B Assigned Counsel Program covers conflict cases and overflow. The right attaches at the first court appearance (arraignment) and continues through trial, sentencing, and the first appeal of right."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "The right to counsel for criminal defendants comes from the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and has been extended to state criminal cases through Gideon v. Wainwright. NY implements the right through County Law Article 18-B, with the key provisions at NY County Law § 722. Each NY county must provide indigent criminal defense through one or more of the structures listed in County Law § 722 — a public defender office, a legal-aid organization under contract, an assigned-counsel panel, or a combination. Monroe County uses a combination: the Monroe County Public Defender's Office handles most felony and misdemeanor cases, and the 18-B Assigned Counsel Program (a panel of private attorneys) covers conflict cases (where the Public Defender already represents a co-defendant) and certain overflow categories. At the first court appearance — usually arraignment — the court asks whether the defendant has a lawyer or needs one assigned. A defendant who states inability to afford counsel completes a short financial questionnaire (Form CJA-23 or the local equivalent) identifying income, assets, and dependents. The judge determines eligibility based on financial guidelines set by the NY Office of Indigent Legal Services and the local public-defender office. Once assigned, the lawyer represents the defendant at no cost for the duration of the case. Assigned counsel has the same ethical duties as a private retained attorney under the NY Rules of Professional Conduct — confidentiality, competent representation, loyalty, communication, and diligence. Anything the defendant tells the assigned lawyer is protected by attorney-client privilege. The lawyer's fees are paid by Monroe County, funded in part by state and federal aid. The defendant does not owe the lawyer anything at the end of the case, though certain cost-reimbursement obligations may apply at sentencing depending on the disposition. The right attaches at critical stages: arraignment, preliminary and felony hearings, grand jury appearances (if the defendant chooses to testify), pretrial motions, plea negotiations, trial, sentencing, and the first appeal of right. After a conviction, the Appellate Division assigns new counsel from its 18-B appellate panel at no cost to the defendant. A defendant dissatisfied with assigned counsel can request a substitution. The court evaluates the request based on whether the problems show a genuine breakdown in communication or ineffective representation, not simply disagreement over strategy. Substitution is discretionary. The NY Office of Indigent Legal Services (ILS) oversees the statewide system and provides training, caseload standards, and funding to county providers. Beyond the Sixth Amendment right, certain Family Court proceedings also carry a right to assigned counsel. NY Family Court Act §§ 261-262 give parents and guardians the right to assigned counsel in Article 10 child-neglect or child-abuse cases, in family-offense proceedings where an order of protection is sought, in permanent neglect/termination-of-parental-rights cases, and in certain other matters. The Monroe County Family Court provides assigned counsel through the same 18-B panel structure."

  example: {
    en: "Kevin was arrested in Rochester on a felony charge and brought before the Rochester City Court for arraignment. The judge asked whether Kevin had a lawyer. Kevin said he could not afford one. The judge had Kevin complete a short financial questionnaire and, based on his income and assets, found him eligible for assigned counsel. Under County Law § 722, the Monroe County Public Defender was assigned. A public defender appeared with Kevin at arraignment, argued for release on recognizance, and continued the representation through preliminary hearing and grand-jury presentation. Kevin met with the attorney the following week at the Public Defender's office at 10 North Fitzhugh Street to review discovery and build a defense. The representation cost Kevin nothing."
