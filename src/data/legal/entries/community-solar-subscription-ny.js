  summary: {
    en: "Community solar lets a New York resident subscribe to a share of a shared solar array and receive credits on the utility bill — no rooftop panels needed. State rules require specific disclosures from community solar providers, a cooling-off period to cancel, and caps on fees. Savings for subscribers vary but are typically 5 to 10 percent. Low-income subscribers often see 20 percent or more through state programs."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Community solar (also called community distributed generation) is a shared solar array whose production is allocated to subscribers. Instead of owning panels, the subscriber buys a share of the array's output. The utility credits the subscriber's bill for their share of the electricity the array produces. The subscriber pays the community solar provider (not the utility) for those credits, usually at a discount to the utility rate. The result is net savings on the electric bill. New York community solar is regulated by the Public Service Commission under Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) tariffs and consumer protection orders. Key consumer protections: required disclosures before sign-up, including the subscription price, the utility bill credit expected, any fees, contract term, and cancellation terms. A standard contract summary must be provided. A 5-business-day cooling-off period after sign-up during which the subscriber can cancel without penalty. Early termination fees are capped. Fixed or escalating pricing must be clearly disclosed. Low-income protections: the state's Solar for All and Expanded Solar for All programs provide enhanced benefits to income-qualified customers — no-cost subscriptions in some cases, with projected savings of 10 to 25 percent. Subscribers do not have to own or finance panels. The community solar provider owns the array. The utility bills and credits flow normally. When moving within the same utility service area, the subscription often transfers. Moving to a different utility requires a new subscription or cancellation (which should be penalty-free under the consumer protection rules). Credits appear on the monthly utility bill as a line item. Some subscribers also receive a separate bill from the community solar provider for the subscription cost. Net savings is bill credit minus subscription cost. Complaints about community solar providers go to the NYS DPS. Most contracts run 20 years to match the array's design life, with portability and termination terms specified at sign-up that should be reviewed against any anticipated move."

  example: {
    en: "A Rochester apartment renter on RG&E electric signed up for a community solar subscription through a provider's website. The sign-up showed a projected 10 percent savings on electric bills. After the cooling-off period elapsed, her first bill arrived with a $42 solar credit from RG&E — and a separate $38 charge from the community solar provider for that month. Net savings: $4 — less than projected but still positive. Over the year she saved about $55 net. Had she signed up for Solar for All instead (she was income-eligible), the savings would have been substantially higher — the enhanced program targets 20 to 25 percent savings for income-qualified customers."
