  summary: {
    en: "If a pharmacy gave you the wrong medication, the wrong dosage, or failed to warn you about a dangerous interaction, you may have a legal claim. You can also report the error to the state licensing board. Quick action can prevent harm and preserve your rights."

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Anyone who received the wrong medication or wrong dosage from a pharmacy.",
      "Anyone who was harmed by a drug interaction that the pharmacist should have caught.",
      "Anyone whose prescription label had incorrect instructions.",
      "Anyone who wants to report a pharmacist or pharmacy for a dispensing error."
    ]
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Pharmacists in New York are licensed and have a legal duty to give the right medication in the right dose with clear labeling. They must also check whether a new prescription might interact badly with other drugs the patient takes. When a pharmacy makes an error that causes harm, the patient may have a legal claim. The question is whether a careful pharmacist would have made the same mistake. Common errors include giving the wrong drug, wrong strength, wrong amount, mixing up one patient's prescription with another's, and missing a dangerous drug interaction. A lawsuit over a pharmacy error must be filed within three years of the mistake. The NYS Education Department licenses pharmacists and can investigate complaints separately. A licensing complaint does not result in money for the patient but can lead to the pharmacist losing their license."

  yourRights: {
    en: [
      "A patient has the right to receive the correct medication, correct dosage, and correct instructions.",
      "A patient has the right to be counseled by the pharmacist about potential side effects and drug interactions.",
      "A patient has the right to request and receive a printout of their medication history from the pharmacy.",
      "A patient harmed by a pharmacy error has the right to file a lawsuit within three years of the error.",
      "A patient has the right to file a complaint with the NYS Education Department regardless of whether they file a lawsuit.",
      "A patient has the right to transfer their prescription to a different pharmacy at any time."

  legalOptions: {
    en: [
      "Under New York law, a lawsuit over a pharmacy error must be filed within three years of the mistake.",
      "The medication that was dispensed in error is evidence. Returning it to the pharmacy makes proving the error harder.",
      "Errors can be reported to the NYS Education Department Office of the Professions at (518) 474-3817.",
      "If the error caused serious harm, a personal injury attorney may take the case on a no-win-no-fee basis.",
      "For claims of $10,000 or less, small claims court is an option without an attorney.",
      "NYS Education Law Section 6816-a sets the rules for when and how pharmacists may swap a brand-name drug for a generic version.",
      "Poison Control is available at (800) 222-1222 for anyone who took the wrong medication and needs guidance on whether to go to the ER."

  example: {
    en: "James picked up his blood pressure medication from a chain pharmacy. At home, he noticed the pills looked different. He called the pharmacy and learned they had accidentally given him another patient's diabetes medication. James had taken one pill before noticing. He went to the ER as a precaution. James filed a complaint with the NYS Education Department and kept both the medication and the pharmacy receipt. The pharmacy's corporate office covered his ER bill and pharmacy records confirmed the dispensing error."
