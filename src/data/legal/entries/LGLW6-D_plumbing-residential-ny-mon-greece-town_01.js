  summary: {
    en: "Greece requires plumbers to register with the Town Building Department before pulling permits. Plumbing work uses the same residential permit form as general building work. The town's own inspectors do plumbing inspections (unlike electrical, which Greece contracts to outside agencies)."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Plumbers have to register with Greece using the town's Plumbers Registration form before they can pull plumbing permits. Registration runs on a 2-year cycle.\n\nFor residential work, Greece uses a single combined application for building AND plumbing permits. This is a paper form you turn in at the Building Department. It's different from Rochester (which uses a separate online portal for plumbing).\n\nA plumbing permit is generally needed for new fixtures, changes to plumbing layout, water heater replacement, sewer line work, and water service line work. Some small projects don't need a permit — the town publishes a list of exemptions (like kiddie pools under 24 inches, artificial lawn ponds, and ventless gas appliances).\n\nPlumbing inspections are done by town inspectors. The town inspection line is (585) 723-1923."

  example: {
    en: "A homeowner in Greece wants to add a half-bath to their basement. They fill out the town's combined residential building/plumbing permit application and turn it in at the Building Department. The town reviews the plans. A registered plumber does the work (or the homeowner does it themselves — call the town to confirm the current homeowner rules). A town inspector checks the rough-in before the walls close, then comes back to check the finished work."
