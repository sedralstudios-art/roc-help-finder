  title: { en: "ERISA Pension Rights — Protecting Retirement Benefits From a Current or Former Employer" },

  summary: {
    en: "The federal ERISA law governs most private-sector pensions and 401(k)s. It requires plan administrators to disclose information, act in participants' best interest, and process claims fairly. A participant who was denied benefits, miscalculated, or frozen out has specific appeal and lawsuit rights. ERISA claims have short deadlines — usually set by the plan itself."

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Any worker or former worker with a vested pension or 401(k) from a private employer.",
      "Any surviving spouse of a worker with a pension who is being denied survivor benefits.",
      "Any person whose pension was frozen, reduced, or terminated.",
      "Any person told their pension plan was mismanaged or the employer went bankrupt."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA, 29 USC Sections 1001-1461) sets minimum standards for most private-sector pension and welfare plans. It does not require an employer to offer a retirement plan, but if one is offered, ERISA applies. Key protections: vesting (benefits become nonforfeitable after a set number of years, typically 3-5), fiduciary duty (plan administrators must act in participants' best interest), funding (defined-benefit plans must be funded to specific levels), reporting and disclosure (participants have the right to a Summary Plan Description and annual statements), and claims procedures (participants who are denied benefits have the right to a written explanation and an appeal). If the plan denies a benefit claim, the participant can request a review under the plan's claims procedure — usually within 60-180 days. If the internal appeal is denied, the participant can file a civil action in federal court under Section 502 of ERISA. Most ERISA claims are decided on the administrative record developed during the internal appeal — so the appeal itself is the critical stage to build the case. When an employer goes bankrupt and cannot fund the pension, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) steps in for qualifying defined-benefit plans, paying benefits up to federal limits. Government, church, and some small-employer plans are exempt from ERISA. Union multiemployer plans have special rules. A surviving spouse has separate ERISA rights to a qualified joint-and-survivor annuity unless the spouse consented to waive it in writing. Defined-contribution plans like 401(k)s and 403(b)s have largely replaced traditional defined-benefit pensions in the private sector. The shift moves investment risk from the employer to the worker, but ERISA's fiduciary protections still apply: plan administrators must offer prudent investment options and disclose fees. Excessive 401(k) fees have driven a wave of lawsuits in the past decade, particularly against large employers whose plans charged retail-level fees when institutional pricing should have been available. Vesting schedules vary: most matching contributions vest gradually over three to six years, and a worker who leaves before fully vested forfeits the unvested employer portion (the worker's own contributions are always 100 percent vested). Rollovers between plans are tax-free if done within 60 days, but the easier method is a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer that avoids withholding. Cashing out a 401(k) before age 59½ triggers a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty plus regular income tax — a costly move that significantly reduces retirement savings."

  example: {
    en: "After working 28 years at a Rochester-area manufacturer, Carlos retired at 65 and filed for his pension. The plan calculated his monthly benefit at $1,800, but he had been told for years it would be closer to $2,400. He requested the Summary Plan Description and his benefit calculation worksheet. Comparing the two showed the plan had used a lower average salary than required by the plan's own formula. He filed an internal appeal within the 180-day window. The plan's second-level review corrected the calculation and increased his monthly benefit by $650 — retroactive to his retirement date."
