  summary: {
    en: "The Town of Clarkson explicitly requires a building permit for all roofing work. The permit fee is $100 for contractor jobs. Homeowners doing their own roofing (DIY) also need a permit but pay no fee. Permit fees are doubled if work begins without a permit. The Village of Brockport, which sits partly inside the Town, has separate code enforcement."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Clarkson's fee schedule explicitly lists roofing as a permit-required activity — both for contractor work ($100 fee) and for homeowners doing their own roofing (permit required, no fee charged). This is one of the clearest roofing permit requirements in Monroe County. The Building Department enforces the NYS Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code under Chapter 52 of the Town Code. If work begins without a permit, the permit fee is doubled. The Town also has a Historic Preservation Board that reviews exterior alterations in the Clarkson Historical Overlay District. The Village of Brockport straddles the Town of Clarkson and the Town of Sweden — verify which jurisdiction your property is in before applying."
  },

  example: {
    en: "A roofing contractor accepts a job on a house in Clarkson, outside the Village of Brockport. Before starting, the contractor contacts the Building Department at 585-637-1145 and applies for a roofing permit, paying the $100 fee. If the contractor had started work without the permit, the fee would have been $200."
