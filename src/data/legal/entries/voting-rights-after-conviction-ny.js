  title: { en: "Voting Rights After a Criminal Conviction in New York" },

  summary: {
    en: "In New York, a person convicted of a felony loses the right to vote only while incarcerated. As soon as the person is released from prison — whether on parole, probation, or unconditionally — the right to vote is restored. This has been the law since 2021, when the governor signed an executive order restoring voting rights to people on parole. Many people with felony convictions do not know they can vote."

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Any person with a felony conviction who is not currently incarcerated in a state or federal prison.",
      "People on parole can vote.",
      "People on probation can vote.",
      "People with misdemeanor convictions never lose the right to vote — even while in jail.",
      "People in local jails awaiting trial (pretrial detention) can vote."
    ]

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Under Election Law § 5-106 and Executive Order 204 (2021, made permanent by legislation in 2023), a person convicted of a felony in New York loses the right to vote only while serving a sentence of incarceration in a state or federal prison. The moment the person is released — whether to parole, a halfway house, or the community — the right to vote is automatically restored. There is no waiting period, no application, and no fee. The person must re-register to vote (the conviction cancels the previous registration), but there is no special process — the standard voter registration form is used. People with misdemeanor convictions never lose the right to vote, even while serving time in a local jail. People in jail who have not been convicted (pretrial detainees) retain the full right to vote and can request an absentee ballot. This is a significant change from the prior law, which barred voting until parole was completed. Many people who are now eligible do not know it because the old rule was in place for decades."
