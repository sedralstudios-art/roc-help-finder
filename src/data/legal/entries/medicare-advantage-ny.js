  summary: {
    en: "Medicare Advantage (Part C) is a private alternative to Original Medicare that combines Parts A and B into one plan, usually includes Part D drug coverage, and often adds dental, vision, and hearing benefits. Most Monroe County Advantage plans have zero premium beyond the Part B premium. Trade-off: network restrictions and prior authorization. Annual open enrollment October 15 to December 7."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Medicare Advantage (Part C) is authorized under 42 USC 1395w-21 and regulated by CMS. A private insurer (Humana, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Excellus BlueCross BlueShield, MVP, Fidelis Care, Highmark, and others) contracts with the federal government to provide Medicare-covered services plus extras. The beneficiary still pays the standard Part B premium (174.70 dollars per month in 2024, adjusting annually) but most Medicare Advantage plans in Monroe County have 0 dollars additional monthly premium. About 52 percent of Medicare-eligible Americans and about 48 percent of Monroe County Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage as of 2025. Plans generally fall into 4 types. HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) — lowest premium, requires using in-network providers except for emergencies, often requires primary-care referrals to specialists. PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) — slightly higher premium, allows out-of-network care at higher cost, no referrals needed. PFFS (Private Fee-For-Service) — rare, any Medicare-accepting provider willing to accept the plan terms. SNP (Special Needs Plan) — for specific populations like dual-eligibles (both Medicare and Medicaid), chronic-condition groups, or institutional residents. BENEFITS BEYOND ORIGINAL MEDICARE: Most Advantage plans include Part D prescription drug coverage. Typical extras include dental (cleanings, fillings, sometimes dentures), vision (eye exams and glasses allowance), hearing (exams and hearing aid allowance), gym membership (SilverSneakers or similar), over-the-counter benefit ($50 to $150 quarterly), transportation to medical appointments, meal delivery after hospital discharge, and telehealth. These extras are the main selling point against Original Medicare plus Medigap. COST STRUCTURE: Zero or low monthly premium. Modest copays for doctor visits (typically 0 to 30 dollars primary care, 35 to 55 specialist), hospital copays (250 to 400 dollars per day for days 1 to 7), and Part D drug tiers. Annual out-of-pocket maximum capped by federal rule (9,350 in-network for 2026). COMPARED TO ORIGINAL MEDICARE: Advantage pros — lower out-of-pocket, extra benefits, annual cap on spending, coordinated care. Advantage cons — network restrictions, prior authorization required for many procedures, coverage limits on post-hospital nursing home stays, some doctors do not accept specific Advantage plans. Original Medicare plus Medigap pros — any Medicare-accepting provider nationwide, no prior auth, predictable coverage. Cons — higher monthly cost (Part B plus Medigap plus Part D), no extras like dental/vision/hearing, no annual cap without Medigap. ENROLLMENT PERIODS: Initial Enrollment is 7 months (3 before 65th birthday, month of, 3 after). Annual Open Enrollment October 15 to December 7 for changes effective January 1. Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment January 1 to March 31 allows a one-time switch from one Advantage plan to another or back to Original Medicare plus Part D. Special Enrollment Periods apply after moving, losing employer coverage, or certain other life events. NY DOES NOT ADD state-level guaranteed issue for Medicare Advantage (unlike Medigap) because Advantage is federally regulated. However, NY does require Advantage insurers to meet certain network adequacy standards under NY DFS rules. FOR MONROE COUNTY BENEFICIARIES: Humana, UnitedHealthcare, Excellus BCBS, and MVP all offer multiple plans in the region. Plan details vary yearly — annual review during Open Enrollment is important. HIICAP counseling at Monroe County Office for the Aging at (585) 753-6280 compares plans. Medicare.gov Plan Finder at medicare.gov/plan-compare is the official tool that compares plans by drug list, provider network, and total estimated cost. A beneficiary's preferred doctors should be checked against each plan's provider directory before enrolling. Switching plans has real consequences — a new network means possibly new doctors, and Medigap is no longer guaranteed issue after the initial window in most states, though NY is the exception."

  example: {
    en: "Consuelo turned 65 and compared her options in Monroe County. As a healthy person with predictable medication needs, she chose a zero-premium Humana Medicare Advantage HMO plan that included Part D, dental cleanings, vision allowance, and a gym membership. Her total monthly Medicare cost was just the 174.70 Part B premium. She saved roughly 250 to 300 dollars per month compared to Original Medicare plus Medigap plus Part D. When her cardiologist required prior authorization for a specific test, the plan approved within 5 days. Her HIICAP counselor reminded her to recompare during next Open Enrollment because drug prices and benefits change annually."
