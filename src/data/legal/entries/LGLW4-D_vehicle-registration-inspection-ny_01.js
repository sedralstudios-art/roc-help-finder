  summary: {
    en: "Every vehicle driven on public roads in New York must be registered, inspected annually, and insured. Driving without any of these can result in tickets, fines, vehicle impoundment, and license suspension. Understanding the requirements and where to get help if you cannot afford them can prevent a minor lapse from becoming a major problem."

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Any person who owns or operates a motor vehicle on public roads in New York.",
      "Registration, inspection, and insurance requirements apply to all passenger cars, trucks, motorcycles, and most trailers.",
      "Vehicles that are not driven on public roads (farm-use only, stored, etc.) may be exempt from some requirements."
    ]
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Registration: every vehicle must be registered with the NY DMV. Registration must be renewed every two years. Driving with expired registration is a traffic infraction and can result in a fine and points. Inspection: every registered vehicle must pass a safety and emissions inspection once a year at a licensed inspection station. An inspection sticker that is more than 60 days expired can result in a ticket. A vehicle that fails inspection must be repaired and re-inspected. Insurance: New York requires minimum liability insurance on every registered vehicle. The minimum is 25/50/10 (bodily injury per person/per accident/property damage) plus no-fault coverage. Driving without insurance is a serious offense — the registration is suspended, and reinstating it requires paying a civil penalty plus showing proof of new insurance. If any of these lapse and you are pulled over or involved in an accident, the consequences compound quickly — tickets, fines, suspension, impoundment, and even criminal charges in some cases (driving while suspended)."

  example: {
    en: "A driver in Gates lets his insurance lapse for one month because of a tight budget. The insurance company notifies the DMV, which suspends his registration. He does not realize it until he is pulled over and ticketed for driving with a suspended registration. He reinstates coverage with a new insurance policy, pays the DMV civil penalty, and resolves the ticket in court. The judge reduces the fine because he acted quickly."
