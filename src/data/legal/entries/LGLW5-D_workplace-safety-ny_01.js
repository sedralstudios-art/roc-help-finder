  summary: {
    en: "Every worker in New York has the right to a safe workplace. Federal OSHA and New York's PESH (Public Employee Safety and Health) protect workers from hazards. You can report unsafe conditions anonymously, and your employer cannot retaliate against you for reporting."

      "All private-sector workers in New York are covered by federal OSHA.",

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (federal) and New York Labor Law § 27-a (PESH for public employees), employers must provide a workplace free from recognized hazards that can cause death or serious harm. This includes proper safety equipment, training, ventilation, fall protection, chemical handling procedures, and more. Workers have the right to report unsafe conditions to OSHA or PESH without the employer knowing who filed the complaint. OSHA can inspect the workplace, issue citations, and impose fines. In New York, employers also cannot retaliate against workers who refuse to perform work they reasonably believe is dangerous — this is protected under Labor Law § 740 (the whistleblower law, expanded in 2022)."

  example: {
    en: "Maria works in a factory where the ventilation system is broken, causing employees to breathe chemical fumes. She tells her supervisor, who does nothing. Maria files an anonymous complaint with OSHA online. An inspector visits the factory, finds the violation, and orders the employer to fix the ventilation within 30 days. Maria's name is never disclosed to the employer."
