  whatItMeans: {
    en: "SNAP stands for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. It used to be called food stamps. Each month, your benefits get loaded onto an EBT card. The card works like a debit card at grocery stores, farmers markets, and some online stores.\n\nHow much you get depends on how many people are in your household, your income, and what you can deduct. Deductions include rent, utilities, childcare, and medical costs.\n\nNew York makes it easier to qualify than most states. Most states use 130% of the Federal Poverty Level as the income cutoff. In New York, most households can qualify up to 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. After deductions, your \"net income\" must be at or below 100% of the Federal Poverty Level.\n\nIncome limits and benefit amounts change every October 1. Current numbers are at otda.ny.gov."

  example: {
    en: "Maria is a single mother of two. She works part-time earning $2,100 a month. After deductions for rent, utilities, and childcare, her net income falls below the limit. She applied for SNAP online at mybenefits.ny.gov. Her local DSS called her for a phone interview within two weeks. She was approved. Now she gets monthly benefits on her EBT card. She uses the card at her local grocery store and at a farmers market in summer."
