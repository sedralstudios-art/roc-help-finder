  summary: {
    en: "New York State sets the floor for residential roofing work — building code, insurance, and wage protections that apply everywhere in the state. Towns and villages add their own permit rules on top."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Roofing work on one- and two-family homes in New York falls under the NYS Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code. Paid contractors must carry workers comp and disability insurance under NY Workers' Compensation Law, or to hold a state waiver for people who work for themselves with no employees. Home improvement contractor licensing is required in New York City and the downstate counties of Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, and Putnam. Most of upstate New York, including Monroe County, has no statewide contractor license — licensing is handled town by town."
  },

  example: {
    en: "A day laborer is hired in cash to tear off and replace a roof in a Monroe County suburb. The homeowner refuses to pay the agreed amount after the work is done. Even with no written contract and no contractor license, New York Labor Law protects the worker's right to be paid for hours worked, and the NYS Mechanic's Lien Law allows an unpaid laborer to place a lien against the property where they performed the work."
