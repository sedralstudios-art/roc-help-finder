  summary: {
    en: "Parole is supervised release from state prison. A person on parole lives in the community under conditions set by the Board of Parole and is supervised by a parole officer employed by the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS). Breaking the conditions can result in being sent back to prison. New York also uses post-release supervision (PRS) for people who have completed their prison sentence but still have a supervision period."

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Anyone serving a state prison sentence in New York who becomes eligible for release before the maximum term expires.",
      "Anyone required to serve a period of post-release supervision (PRS) after completing a determinate prison sentence.",
      "Family members seeking to understand what parole or PRS means for a loved one."
    ]
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Parole releases a person from prison before the full sentence is served, under supervision. The Board of Parole decides whether to grant parole based on factors including the crime, behavior in prison, risk assessment, and release plan. Conditions typically include living at an approved address, meeting with a parole officer regularly, maintaining employment, avoiding certain people and places, submitting to drug tests, and not getting arrested. Post-release supervision (PRS) is similar but applies to determinate sentences — the supervision period is set by the judge at sentencing (usually 1.5 to 5 years depending on the offense class) and begins automatically when the prison term ends. Lawful cannabis use cannot be the basis for a parole violation in New York since the 2021 MRTA. If a person violates parole or PRS conditions, DOCCS can issue a warrant, and the person faces a hearing where the violation must be proved. The parole officer has significant discretion — minor violations are often addressed with graduated sanctions rather than revocation."
