  title: { en: "Residential HVAC Work in the Village of Fairport — No Village HVAC License, In-House Inspection" },

  summary: {
    en: "The Village of Fairport follows the New York Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code for HVAC work, including the Mechanical Code and the Fuel Gas Code. The village does not license HVAC contractors directly. Gas line work attached to a new furnace still needs a qualified plumber (gas piping is plumbing work). Village staff inspect the HVAC work in-house rather than delegating to third-party agencies. The 2025 NY Energy Code applies to permits filed after December 31, 2025. The Building Department at [number being verified] confirms scope and fees."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Fairport Village enforces the New York Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code (adopted statewide under Executive Law 379) for all HVAC work inside village limits. The Uniform Code incorporates the International Mechanical Code (IMC) and the International Fuel Gas Code (IFGC), along with New York state-specific amendments. HVAC work in the village means compliance with those codes.\n\nNo village HVAC license. The village does not license HVAC contractors. New York does not have a statewide HVAC license either — the statewide trade is self-regulated through insurance, EPA certifications, and the Home Improvement Contractor requirements.\n\nGas line work is plumbing. Any gas line installation or alteration attached to a new HVAC unit (furnace, boiler, water heater, range tied to a new HVAC system) is plumbing work. It requires a qualified plumber and a separate plumbing permit. This is a common source of friction on furnace replacement jobs — the HVAC contractor pulls the mechanical permit, and a plumber pulls a separate permit for the gas line from the meter to the appliance.\n\nIn-house inspection. Unlike electrical (which uses third-party inspection agencies), the village does HVAC inspections in-house. Village Building Department staff inspect the mechanical installation. This makes scheduling simpler but also means inspection availability depends on village staff capacity rather than agency availability.\n\n2025 Energy Code. New York adopted the 2020 Energy Conservation Construction Code (ECCCNYS), with the stretch code update taking effect after December 31, 2025. Permits filed after that date have to meet the newer efficiency standards. For HVAC work, that means minimum AFUE ratings for furnaces (typically 95 percent for gas), minimum SEER2 for air conditioners, and tighter duct sealing requirements. The local code enforcement officer can confirm the applicable edition for a specific permit date.\n\nEPA Section 608 certification. Anyone handling refrigerant — including during AC or heat pump installation, repair, or removal — must have federal EPA Section 608 certification under 40 CFR Part 82. This is a federal requirement that applies regardless of state or local licensing. A homeowner cannot legally recover refrigerant when replacing an old unit.\n\nFairport Electric coordination. Fairport runs its own electric utility (Fairport Electric, part of the Fairport Municipal Commission) at [number being verified]. HVAC jobs that involve electric-side changes — a new service disconnect, a new dedicated circuit, or a main service upgrade to support a heat pump — require coordination with Fairport Electric in addition to the village Building Department.\n\nJurisdictional boundary. The Village of Fairport sits inside the Town of Perinton. A property with a Fairport, NY 14450 mailing address can sit in village limits or in surrounding Perinton. The two offices do not share permit files. The Monroe County Real Property Portal confirms which office governs a specific address.\n\nHomeowner self-work. The village's public code does not clearly address whether homeowners can pull HVAC permits and do the work personally. Village Building Inspector Mark Lenzi confirms the current rule at [number being verified].\n\nState protections. Wage theft protections (Labor Law 191 and 193), the Scaffold Law for elevated work (Labor Law 240 and 241(6)), mechanic's liens (Lien Law 3 and 10), and General Business Law 349 for deceptive home-improvement practices apply in Fairport village as statewide. The statewide hvac-residential-ny entry covers those layers."

  example: {
    en: "A homeowner in Fairport village replaces an old natural-gas furnace with a new high-efficiency condensing furnace. The HVAC contractor files the mechanical permit with the village Building Department. A separate plumber files a plumbing permit for the new gas line from the meter to the furnace. Village staff inspect both the mechanical and plumbing installations. Because the permit is filed after December 31, 2025, the new furnace has to meet the 2025 Energy Code's 95 percent AFUE minimum for gas furnaces."
