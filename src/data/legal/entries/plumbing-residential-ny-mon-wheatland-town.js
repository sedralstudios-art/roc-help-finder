  },

  summary: {
    en: "Wheatland has some of the strictest plumbing permit language in Monroe County. A permit is required for any new plumbing OR any alteration of existing plumbing. Starting work without a permit costs 4 times the permit fee plus a $100 stop-work order. Scottsville village is inside Wheatland but has its own code office."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Wheatland town code says directly: \"In all cases where there is to be installation of new plumbing or alteration of existing plumbing, a plumbing permit must be obtained.\" That's strict — it covers alterations, not just new installs. Water heater replacement, moving fixtures, and almost any other plumbing change triggers the permit.\n\nThe town's enforcement penalties are sharp. Work done without a required permit gets charged 4 times the normal permit cost. A separate $100 stop-work order also applies.\n\nFees are set by Town Board resolution. Exact amounts aren't on the public website — call [number being verified] to confirm.\n\nWheatland doesn't have its own plumber license chapter (unlike Scottsville village, which does register plumbers). Plumbers need liability insurance and workers comp. Whether Wheatland honors a Rochester Examining Board plumber certificate is not published.\n\nThe town Building Department and Fire Marshal do plan review and inspections in-house.\n\nIMPORTANT: Scottsville village is inside Wheatland but has its own Code Enforcement office for village-limit addresses."

  example: {
    en: "A Wheatland homeowner decides to move the washing machine to a different room. Under Wheatland's strict language, moving existing plumbing counts as \"alteration of existing plumbing\" — a permit is required. If they started work without one, the fee would be 4x plus $100. They call the Building Department first and file the permit, saving themselves hundreds of dollars."
