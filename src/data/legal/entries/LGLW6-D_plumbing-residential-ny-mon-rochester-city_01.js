  summary: {
    en: "Rochester has its own Examining Board of Plumbers. Plumbers must get a city license before they can pull permits. Unlike NYC and Buffalo, Rochester lets a homeowner do their own plumbing in their own single-family home — as long as they pull a permit. Plumbing permits are separate from building permits and must be filed through the city's online portal."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Anyone doing plumbing work as a business in Rochester has to pass the city's Examining Board of Plumbers. There are three license types: master plumber, employed/employing plumber, and plumbing inspector. The license fee is $120. The Board office is at City Hall Room 121B, phone (585) 428-9339. Rochester's plumbing rules are in Chapter 40 of the City Code.\n\nPlumbing permits are separate from building permits. You have to file them online through the city's CIVICS portal at infor.cityofrochester.gov. A licensed city plumber can pull the permit, OR the owner of a single-family home (working on their own home) can pull it. This is unusual — most big NY cities like New York City and Buffalo don't let homeowners pull their own plumbing permits.\n\nCity plumbing inspectors do the inspections. This is different from electrical work, where Rochester uses outside agencies."

  example: {
    en: "A homeowner in the South Wedge wants to add a second bathroom. She files a plumbing permit through the CIVICS portal. Because she owns and lives in the house, she can pull the permit herself and do the work. A city plumbing inspector comes to check the rough-in before the walls close up, and comes back to check the finished work after the fixtures are installed."
