  summary: {
    en: "New York sets the floor for furnace, AC, heat pump, and other heating and cooling work. That includes the building code, the energy code (which got stricter on December 31, 2025), a federal rule about handling refrigerants, and worker protections. Towns and villages run the permit and inspection process."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "HVAC work (heating, ventilation, air conditioning) on homes in New York has to follow the NYS Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code. That code includes the Mechanical Code and the Fuel Gas Code. The Energy Conservation Construction Code of NY State (ECCCNYS) also applies — and the 2025 version of that code took effect December 31, 2025. Permits filed after that date have to meet the stricter energy rules.\n\nThere is NO statewide HVAC contractor license in New York. Licensing is local. Most Monroe County towns don't license HVAC contractors at all. They do require a licensed PLUMBER for gas line work (the pipe from the gas meter to the furnace). HVAC techs can set and connect the furnace, but the gas piping itself is plumbing work.\n\nAnyone who handles refrigerant (the stuff that makes AC cold) must have federal EPA Section 608 certification. This is a lifetime certification — no renewal — but it's required by federal law (40 CFR Part 82).\n\nHVAC inspections are done by the town Building Inspector directly — NOT by third-party agencies (that's different from electrical, which does use third-party agencies in NY).\n\nIn most of upstate New York, a homeowner can do HVAC work on their own home. A permit and inspection are still required. NYC does NOT allow homeowner HVAC work."

  example: {
    en: "A homeowner in a Monroe County suburb wants to replace an old oil furnace with a new gas furnace. This is a big job. The homeowner needs: (1) a mechanical permit from the town for the furnace, (2) a plumbing permit for the gas line (pulled by a licensed plumber), (3) a chimney review, and (4) inspections after install. The town Building Inspector — not a third-party agency — does the inspection. Because the permit is filed after December 31, 2025, the new furnace has to meet the 2025 Energy Code efficiency rules."
