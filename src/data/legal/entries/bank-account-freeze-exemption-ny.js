  title: { en: "Frozen Bank Account — Exempt Funds and How to Get Them Released" },

  summary: {
    en: "When a creditor gets a judgment, the creditor can freeze a bank account to collect. But certain funds are protected — Social Security, SSI, veterans benefits, unemployment, public assistance, child support, and a base $3,600 for any New Yorker. The bank must send an Exemption Notice with two claim forms. Filing the Exemption Claim Form within 20 days can unfreeze the protected money."

    en: [
      "Any New York resident whose bank account was frozen because of a court judgment.",
      "Any account holder who receives Social Security, SSI, SSDI, veterans benefits, public assistance, or unemployment deposited in the frozen account.",
      "Any account holder who received child support deposits into the frozen account.",
      "Any low-income account holder who believes the freeze leaves them with no money to live on."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Under New York Civil Practice Law and Rules Section 5222-a (the Exempt Income Protection Act), a bank that receives a restraining notice or levy on a judgment debtor's account must look at the last 45 days of deposits. If any deposits appear to be from an exempt source (electronic deposits that look like Social Security, SSI, veterans benefits, unemployment, or public assistance), the bank must automatically leave those funds accessible. Separately, the first $3,600 in any account is automatically protected under CPLR Section 5222(i) — this baseline applies to every New Yorker regardless of the source of funds. For funds that appear non-exempt, the bank freezes them but must mail the account holder two copies of an Exemption Notice and Exemption Claim Form within two business days. The account holder has 20 days to complete and return the Claim Form with proof (bank statements, benefits letters, pay stubs). Once the claim is filed, the bank has 7 days to release the exempt funds unless the creditor objects. Common exempt sources include Social Security retirement, SSI, SSDI, veterans benefits, federal and state unemployment, public assistance (TA, SNAP cash assistance), child and spousal support, railroad retirement, and the $3,600 baseline. The restraining notice itself is only valid for one year and cannot touch funds deposited after it was served (new deposits restart the 45-day look-back). A creditor that froze exempt funds in bad faith can be liable for the account holder's damages. Joint accounts complicate the picture. A judgment against one account holder reaches funds in a joint account, but the non-debtor account holder can claim back their share by filing an exemption claim with proof of contribution. Documentation matters — the non-debtor needs deposit history showing the source of funds. Direct deposits identified by the federal payment originator code (the routing pattern that signals Social Security or VA payments) are auto-protected; benefits paid by paper check and then deposited may not be auto-protected because the bank cannot identify them, so a manual exemption claim is required."

  example: {
    en: "After a default judgment on a medical debt, a tenant in Rochester found her bank account frozen with $2,400 in it. The entire balance came from her monthly Social Security Disability deposit. The bank mailed the Exemption Notice and two Claim Forms. She filled out one Claim Form marking the SSDI box and mailed it to the bank and the creditor's attorney with a copy of her SSDI award letter. Within a week, the bank released all the funds. The freeze on future SSDI deposits was lifted automatically under CPLR 5222-a."
