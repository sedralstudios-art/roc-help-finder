  summary: {
    en: "A hospital cannot safely discharge a patient without a workable plan. New York Public Health Law and federal Medicare rules require written discharge instructions, caregiver designation and training under the CARE Act, and prompt notice when a patient is on observation status rather than admitted. A patient who believes discharge is unsafe has the right to a quick independent review."

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Any patient in a New York hospital facing discharge.",
      "Any family member or caregiver involved in a patient's post-hospital care.",
      "Any Medicare beneficiary receiving outpatient observation services rather than inpatient admission.",
      "Any patient or family member who believes a planned discharge is unsafe or premature."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Hospital discharge is regulated under several layers of law. New York Public Health Law Section 2803 and the NY Patients' Bill of Rights (10 NYCRR Part 405.7) require every hospital to involve the patient and chosen caregiver in discharge planning, provide written discharge instructions in the patient's primary language, and arrange post-discharge care. The NY Caregiver Advise, Record, Enable Act (CARE Act, enacted 2016, codified at PHL Section 2803-w) gives a hospital patient the right to designate a caregiver upon admission, have the caregiver's name recorded in the medical record, be notified when the hospital plans to discharge, and receive in-person or telephone instruction on any medical or nursing tasks the caregiver will perform at home (medication management, wound care, injections, and the like). Federal NOTICE Act (42 USC 1395cc) requires hospitals to give Medicare patients who are on observation status (outpatient) rather than admitted (inpatient) a written Medicare Outpatient Observation Notice (MOON) within 36 hours. The difference matters financially — observation does not count toward the 3-day inpatient stay that triggers Medicare coverage for a later skilled nursing facility, and it may leave the patient responsible for outpatient copays instead of the inpatient deductible. A Medicare patient who disagrees with a planned discharge has the right to Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) review — in New York the QIO is Livanta (1-866-815-5440). Requesting a QIO review before the discharge date keeps the hospital stay covered while Livanta reviews the case, and typically produces a decision within 24 hours. Private insurance patients have a similar appeal right under their plan documents — call the plan's member services number. Unsafe discharge (discharging a patient who has nowhere to go, no family support, unmanaged pain, or unstable medical conditions) can be reported to NYS DOH at 1-800-804-5447. Hospital social workers and discharge planners are the first point of contact — they can arrange home health aides, durable medical equipment, visiting nurses, transportation home, and short-term nursing home placement when needed."

  example: {
    en: "A Rochester Medicare beneficiary was admitted to a hospital for heart failure, stayed four nights, and was told she would be discharged in the morning. She was too unsteady to walk safely and her daughter (the designated caregiver under the CARE Act) had not yet received training on the new diuretic schedule. The daughter asked for the hospital social worker, who arranged a bedside caregiver training session and a home health aide referral. The daughter also called Livanta to request QIO review of the discharge timing — Livanta kept Medicare coverage in place overnight while reviewing the case. The review found discharge was premature; the hospital agreed to one more day, arranged visiting nurse services, and discharged her the next afternoon with written instructions and a delivered walker."
