  summary: {
    en: "The City of Rochester requires a building permit for re-roofing and roof replacement. Roofing permit applications must be submitted online — the City does not accept paper roofing applications. Properties in a Preservation District or designated as a Building of Historic Value may also require a Certificate of Appropriateness."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Rochester explicitly requires a roofing permit for roof replacement and structural roof repairs. All roofing permit applications must be submitted through the City's online permitting system — paper applications are not accepted for roofing. Permit fees are calculated on a value-based schedule. The City reviews construction plans for compliance with the NYS Uniform Code and City of Rochester Building Code. Properties located in a Preservation District or designated as a Building of Historic Value may require a Certificate of Appropriateness for exterior work, even when a building permit alone would otherwise suffice. The Permit Office is available by appointment on Tuesdays and Thursdays, with walk-in hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays."
  },

  example: {
    en: "A contractor needs to replace the roof on a house in the 19th Ward neighborhood of Rochester. The contractor submits a roofing permit application through the City's online system and pays the value-based fee. Before starting, the contractor checks whether the property is in a Preservation District — if it is, a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Preservation Board may also be required before exterior work can begin."
