  title: { en: "Child Support Enforcement — How New Hire Reporting and Tax Refund Intercepts Work" },

  summary: {
    en: "New York uses several automated tools to enforce child support — employers must report new hires within 20 days, which triggers wage garnishment within weeks; federal and state tax refunds are intercepted for arrears; and license suspensions (driver, professional) are used when arrears reach thresholds. These mechanics work even when the non-custodial parent does not voluntarily cooperate. Families receiving support owed have specific rights to trigger these tools."

      "Any custodial parent or guardian owed child support.",
      "Any non-custodial parent whose support obligations are in default.",
      "Any employer hiring workers in New York (all employers must comply with new hire reporting).",
      "Any custodial parent who wants to understand the tools available when the other parent does not pay."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "New York Social Services Law Section 111-h establishes the New York State Directory of New Hires. Every employer operating in New York must report each new hire within 20 calendar days of the hire date. The report includes the employee's name, address, SSN, and the employer's identifying information. The state matches new hire data against child support orders in a database maintained by the Support Collection Unit (SCU) under the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance (OTDA). When a match is found, the SCU issues a Income Withholding Order to the employer, typically within weeks of the match. The employer must begin withholding the ordered amount (commonly 25 percent of disposable earnings, capped by federal law at 50-65 percent depending on family circumstances) and remit to the SCU. This process works regardless of the non-custodial parent's cooperation. Federal Tax Refund Intercept: under the federal Treasury Offset Program (31 USC 3716) and NY Tax Law 171-c, federal and NY state tax refunds are intercepted to apply to child support arrears. The non-custodial parent is notified in advance and can contest the amount. Intercepts can cover current and past-due support. License suspensions: when child support arrears reach four months of unpaid obligation (generally), OTDA can request suspension of the non-custodial parent's driver license, professional license (medical, law, real estate), recreational license (hunting, fishing), or passport. Restricted driving privileges (conditional license) may be available for work. Credit Reporting: arrears over $1,000 are reported to credit bureaus. Contempt of Court: as a last resort, chronic non-payment can lead to contempt proceedings and jail time. For custodial parents: child support applications are filed with the local Support Collection Unit. Monroe County SCU is at (585) 753-6200. Cases can originate through Family Court, divorce decrees, or administrative process. For low-income custodial parents on Temporary Assistance, child support collection is automatic — the family assigns support rights to the state in exchange for TA benefits."

  example: {
    en: "A custodial parent in Rochester had a child support order that had been unpaid for three months. She contacted the Monroe County Support Collection Unit, which searched the New Hires Directory and confirmed the non-custodial parent had started a new job two months earlier in Buffalo. The SCU issued an Income Withholding Order to the new employer within three weeks. The employer began withholding the ordered amount from each paycheck and remitting to the SCU, which forwarded it to the custodial parent. Federal tax refund intercept recovered an additional lump sum when the non-custodial parent filed taxes the following year."
