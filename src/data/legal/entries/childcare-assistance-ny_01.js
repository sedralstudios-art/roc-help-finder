  whatItMeans: {
    en: "The Child Care Assistance Program is funded by the federal Child Care and Development Fund. It is administered locally by each county\u2019s Department of Social Services. The program is overseen by the NYS Office of Children and Family Services. If you qualify, the subsidy covers most of the cost of child care. Families pay a weekly parent fee based on income. The minimum weekly fee is one dollar. Families receiving Temporary Assistance pay no fee. The subsidy is paid directly to the child care provider. You can choose from licensed child care centers, registered family day care homes, or legally exempt providers. A legally exempt provider can be a family member or trusted friend. Once approved, your eligibility is guaranteed for 12 months. Your parent fee will not change during that period. Income limits are based on the State Median Income and are updated each year. Current limits are published by OCFS and by your local Department of Social Services."
