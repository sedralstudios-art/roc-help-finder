  title: { en: "Housing Discrimination — Illegal Reasons a Landlord Can Reject an Applicant in New York" },

  summary: {
    en: "In New York, landlords cannot refuse to rent to someone based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status (having children), disability, age, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, military status, source of income (including Section 8 vouchers), or domestic violence victim status. Source-of-income discrimination — refusing to accept vouchers — is one of the most common violations in Monroe County."

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Any person who has been denied housing, treated differently, or harassed by a landlord based on a protected characteristic.",
      "Any person whose Section 8 voucher, VASH voucher, or other lawful source of income was rejected by a landlord.",
      "Any person told 'no children,' 'no families,' or 'adults only' for housing that is not legally age-restricted.",
      "Any person denied a reasonable accommodation for a disability (see the disability housing accommodation entry)."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "The Fair Housing Act (federal), the New York State Human Rights Law (Executive Law § 296), and local ordinances all prohibit housing discrimination. In New York, the protected categories are broader than federal law — they include source of income, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and marital status. Source-of-income discrimination means a landlord cannot refuse to rent to someone simply because they plan to pay with a Section 8 voucher, a VASH voucher, FHEPS, or any other form of government rental assistance. This is one of the most common violations in the Rochester area. Familial status discrimination means a landlord cannot refuse to rent to families with children (except in legitimate senior housing). Disability discrimination means a landlord must provide reasonable accommodations and allow reasonable modifications. The NY Division of Human Rights (DHR) investigates housing discrimination complaints. A complaint must be filed within 1 year of the discriminatory act for DHR, or within 2 years for a federal Fair Housing Act complaint with HUD. Steering and redlining are subtle forms of discrimination that still occur. Steering happens when a landlord or real estate agent shows certain neighborhoods to people of certain races or backgrounds and steers them away from others; this violates fair housing law even when no overt statement is made. Redlining historically meant denying mortgages or insurance based on neighborhood demographics; modern algorithmic versions can produce similar effects through supposedly neutral models. The Community Reinvestment Act requires banks to serve all neighborhoods in their service area without discrimination. Tester programs operated by fair housing organizations send paired applicants of different demographics to apply for the same housing and document differential treatment. Test results are admissible evidence and have produced large settlements against landlords with discriminatory practices. Specific local rules in Monroe County: Rochester city ordinance and the Monroe County Human Rights Law mirror state protections and add some categories. Tenant screening criteria — credit score minimums, criminal background checks, eviction history searches — must be applied consistently to all applicants, not selectively, to avoid creating disparate-impact violations even without intent to discriminate."

  example: {
    en: "A single mother with a Section 8 voucher finds a suitable apartment in Irondequoit. The landlord says the apartment is available, but when she mentions the voucher, the landlord says he does not accept Section 8. She files a complaint with DHR citing source-of-income discrimination under Executive Law § 296. DHR investigates and finds probable cause. The case settles with the landlord agreeing to accept the voucher, paying compensatory damages, and attending fair housing training."
