  whatItMeans: {
    en: "New York has two Temporary Assistance programs:\n\nFamily Assistance is for families with kids. It's funded by the federal TANF program (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families). Adults on Family Assistance have a 5-year lifetime limit (60 months total).\n\nSafety Net Assistance is for single adults, couples without kids, and families that have used up their 5 years. It's funded by the state and county. There is no federal time limit.\n\nSometimes the cash goes straight to your landlord or utility company instead of to you. How much you get depends on your household size, income, and where you live.\n\nAdults who can work usually have to do work activities, job training, or education while getting benefits.\n\nWhen you apply, you're also checked for SNAP and Medicaid at the same time.\n\nIf you get Family Assistance, you usually have to help the county collect child support from the other parent. You can skip this if you have a good reason, like domestic violence."

  example: {
    en: "Tanya is a single mother with two young children. She was working part-time, but her hours were cut. She couldn't afford rent anymore. She applied for Temporary Assistance at the Monroe County DSS office. Because she has kids, she was put in the Family Assistance program. The same application also got her SNAP and Medicaid. The cash helps cover rent and basics while she goes through job training set up by DSS."
