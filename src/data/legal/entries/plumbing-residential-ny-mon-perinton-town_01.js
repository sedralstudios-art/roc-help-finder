  summary: {
    en: "Perinton's Building and Codes Department handles plumbing permits for properties outside Fairport village. Permits can be filed online through the town's GovWell portal. Fees for general building permits start at $0.20/sq ft with a $50 minimum — call for plumbing-specific fees."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Perinton runs its own Building and Codes Department for properties outside Fairport village. (Inside the village, you use the Village of Fairport Code Enforcement office instead.)\n\nPlumbing permits go through the town. Perinton has an online portal at app.govwell.com/perinton that takes residential applications.\n\nFees are posted in the town's 2025 Fee Schedule. The general residential building permit fee is $0.20 per square foot with a $50 minimum. Plumbing-specific fee structure (per-fixture vs. flat) isn't as clear in the public schedule — call (585) 223-0770 to confirm.\n\nThe town doesn't have a separate plumber license chapter. Plumbers need liability insurance and workers comp. Whether Perinton honors a Rochester Examining Board plumber certificate is not published."
