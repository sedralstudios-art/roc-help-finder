  title: { en: "Reasonable Accommodation for Disability in Rental Housing" },

  summary: {
    en: "Under both federal and New York law, landlords must provide reasonable accommodations for tenants with disabilities. This includes changes to rules, policies, or services that allow a person with a disability to use and enjoy their home equally. It also includes allowing reasonable physical modifications to the unit. Service animals and emotional support animals must be allowed even in no-pet buildings."
  },

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Any tenant or housing applicant with a physical or mental disability that substantially limits one or more major life activities.",
      "Any tenant who needs a service animal or emotional support animal.",
      "Any tenant who needs a policy exception (like a reserved parking space, an exception to a guest policy, or a different payment schedule).",
      "The law applies to nearly all housing, including private rentals, public housing, and condos/co-ops."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Under the Fair Housing Act (federal) and the New York State Human Rights Law (Executive Law § 296), landlords and housing providers must make reasonable accommodations and allow reasonable modifications for people with disabilities. A reasonable accommodation is a change to a rule, policy, or service — like allowing a service animal in a no-pet building, reserving an accessible parking space, or permitting a rent payment schedule that aligns with disability benefit payment dates. A reasonable modification is a physical change to the unit or common area — like installing grab bars, widening a doorway, or adding a ramp. The tenant pays for modifications in most private housing (the landlord pays in federally assisted housing). The landlord may require that the unit be restored to its original condition when the tenant moves out. The landlord cannot charge extra rent or a pet deposit for a service animal or emotional support animal. The accommodation must be connected to the disability — the tenant may need to provide documentation from a medical or mental health provider if the disability is not obvious. Documentation requests have specific limits. The landlord can ask for verification that the person has a disability and that the requested accommodation is needed because of the disability — but cannot demand medical records, the specific diagnosis, or details about the disability beyond what is necessary to verify the connection. A standard reasonable accommodation request letter from a doctor or mental health provider, stating only that the person has a disability and needs the requested accommodation, is sufficient. Online ESA-letter services have grown into a problem area; HUD has clarified that landlords can require the letter be from a provider with personal knowledge of the tenant's condition, not a stranger who responded to an online form after a brief screening. Multifamily housing built after March 1991 must meet Fair Housing Act accessibility standards (accessible common areas, doors wide enough for wheelchairs, accessible bathrooms in some units), separate from any individual accommodation request. Older buildings are not required to be retrofitted but must allow modifications."

  yourRights: {
    en: [
      "A landlord must provide reasonable accommodations for a disability at no cost to the tenant.",
      "A landlord must allow reasonable physical modifications at the tenant's expense (or the landlord's expense in federally assisted housing).",
      "Service animals and emotional support animals must be allowed in no-pet buildings with no pet deposit or extra fee.",
      "A landlord cannot ask about the nature or severity of a disability — only whether an accommodation is needed and how it connects to the disability.",
      "Denial of a reasonable accommodation is housing discrimination and can be reported to DHR or HUD.",
      "Retaliation for requesting an accommodation is illegal."

      "If an accommodation is denied, a complaint can be filed with the NY Division of Human Rights (DHR) at (888) 392-3644 or with HUD at (800) 669-9777.",
      "Free legal help is available through Legal Aid Society of Rochester at (585) 232-4090 and through the Center for Disability Rights at (585) 546-7510.",
      "A request for accommodation should be made in writing, stating the disability (generally, not in detail), the accommodation needed, and how it is connected to the disability. A letter from a medical or mental health provider can support the request.",
      "For emotional support animals specifically, a letter from a licensed mental health provider stating that the animal is part of the treatment plan is typically sufficient.",
      "Under the Fair Housing Act, the accommodation must be provided unless it would cause an 'undue financial or administrative burden' on the housing provider — a high bar for most landlords."

  example: {
    en: "A tenant with a mobility disability moves into a second-floor apartment in Brighton. She requests that the landlord reserve a ground-level parking space near the entrance. The landlord initially refuses, saying spots are first-come first-served. The tenant submits a written request with a letter from her doctor explaining the need. The landlord grants the accommodation at no cost. Later, the tenant also requests permission to install a grab bar in the bathroom at her own expense. The landlord agrees."
