  },

  summary: {
    en: "The Town of Perinton does not require a building permit for re-roofing, re-siding, flooring, cabinet installation, or replacement of windows and doors when the opening size is not changed. The Village of Fairport, which sits inside the Town, has separate rules."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Re-roofing in the Town of Perinton is explicitly listed as exempt from the building permit requirement, along with re-siding, flooring, cabinet installation, and window or door replacement where the opening is not enlarged. The Building and Codes Department verifies contractor insurance when a contractor is named on any permit application. All state-level rules still apply — Workers' Compensation, NYS Uniform Code compliance, and wage protections. Larger projects involving additions, decks, or major structural renovations do require permits and may require working drawings and a site survey."
  },

  example: {
    en: "A homeowner in Perinton hires a contractor to strip and replace the roof. Because Perinton exempts re-roofing from permits, no application is needed. The homeowner confirms the contractor carries workers comp insurance (pays medical bills if a worker gets hurt on the job). After the job, if the homeowner has concerns about the workmanship, they can contact the Building and Codes Department."
