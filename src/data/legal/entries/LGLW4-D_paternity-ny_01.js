  summary: {
    en: "Paternity is the legal determination of who a child's father is. In New York, if the parents are not married, the father has no legal rights or obligations to the child until paternity is established. This can be done voluntarily by signing an Acknowledgment of Paternity at the hospital, or through a Family Court petition and DNA testing."
  },

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Any mother who wants to legally establish the father of her child.",
      "Any man who believes he is the father and wants legal rights (custody, visitation).",
      "Any man named as the father who wants to confirm or deny paternity.",
      "The child support enforcement agency (SCU) can also file a paternity petition."
    ]
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "When parents are married, the husband is automatically presumed to be the father under New York law. When parents are NOT married, there is no legal father until paternity is established. Without legal paternity, the father has no right to custody or visitation, no obligation to pay child support, and the child has no right to the father's benefits (Social Security, inheritance, health insurance). There are two ways to establish paternity. Voluntary: both parents sign an Acknowledgment of Paternity (AOP) form, usually at the hospital right after birth. This has the same legal effect as a court order. It can be rescinded within 60 days. After 60 days, it can only be challenged in court with DNA evidence. Court petition: either parent (or the SCU) files a paternity petition in Family Court. The court can order DNA testing, which is 99.9% accurate. If the test confirms paternity, the court enters an order of filiation establishing the man as the legal father. Once paternity is established, either parent can file for custody, visitation, and child support."

  example: {
    en: "Aisha and David are not married. Their daughter is born at Strong Memorial. Both parents sign the Acknowledgment of Paternity at the hospital. Three years later, they separate. Because paternity is already established, David has the legal right to file for custody or visitation in Family Court, and Aisha has the right to file for child support. Neither has to go through DNA testing — the AOP they signed already proved paternity."
