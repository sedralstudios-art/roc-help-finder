  summary: {
    en: "If your health insurance denies a claim, refuses to cover a treatment, or says a service is not medically necessary, you have the right to appeal. New York law requires insurance companies to have an internal appeal process, and if that fails, an independent external review. Many denials are overturned on appeal — especially when the treating doctor supports the request."

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Anyone with health insurance (private, employer, marketplace, Medicaid managed care, or Child Health Plus) who has had a claim or service denied.",
      "Anyone whose insurance says a prescribed treatment, test, or medication is not medically necessary.",
      "Anyone whose prior authorization request was denied."
    ]
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "When a health insurance company denies a claim, it must send a written denial notice explaining the reason and the right to appeal. The appeal process has two levels. First: an internal appeal to the insurance company itself. The insurer must review the denial using a different reviewer than the one who made the original decision. For urgent cases (where delay could seriously harm health), the insurer must fast-track the review. Second: if the internal appeal is denied, the member can request an external review by an independent review organization (not affiliated with the insurer). The external reviewer's decision is binding on the insurer. Under New York Insurance Law § 4914, the external review process is free and available for denials based on medical necessity, experimental/investigational treatment, out-of-network referrals, and certain other grounds. For Medicaid managed care, the appeal goes through the plan's internal process and then to a Medicaid fair hearing. The treating doctor's support is often the strongest factor in winning an appeal."

  example: {
    en: "A patient's insurance denies coverage for a prescribed MRI, saying it is not medically necessary. The patient's doctor writes a letter of medical necessity explaining why the MRI is needed. The patient files an internal appeal with the doctor's letter attached. The insurer reverses the denial. If the insurer had upheld the denial, the patient could have requested a free external review through the Department of Financial Services."
