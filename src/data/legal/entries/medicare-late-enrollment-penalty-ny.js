  title: { en: "Medicare Late Enrollment Penalty — When the Premium Goes Up Permanently and How to Avoid It" },

  summary: {
    en: "Medicare Part B and Part D can carry lifetime late-enrollment penalties for people who delay signing up without qualifying other coverage. The Part B penalty is 10 percent per each 12 months of delay, paid on top of the premium forever. The Part D penalty is 1 percent per month uncovered. Several exceptions exist — retiree coverage, employer coverage for the person or spouse, or delay because of living abroad."

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Anyone turning 65 who needs to decide whether to enroll in Medicare.",
      "Anyone already over 65 who delayed enrollment and is now facing or paying a late penalty.",
      "Anyone leaving employer coverage after age 65 and needing to enroll in Medicare within a deadline.",
      "Anyone with a disability who was enrolled in Medicare through SSDI and is reviewing premium changes."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Medicare has four parts: A (hospital — usually premium-free), B (doctor and outpatient — monthly premium, about $175 for most in 2025), C (Medicare Advantage), and D (prescription drugs). Most people must enroll during their Initial Enrollment Period (IEP), which is the seven-month window around their 65th birthday month (three months before, the birth month, and three months after). Missing this window without qualifying other coverage can trigger penalties. Part B penalty (42 USC Section 1395r): 10 percent of the Part B premium for each full 12-month period the person was eligible but not enrolled. Example — someone who delays Part B for three years and then enrolls pays an extra 30 percent of the Part B premium every month, for life. Part D penalty: 1 percent of the national base beneficiary premium for each month without creditable prescription drug coverage. Example — someone uncovered for 18 months pays about 18 percent extra on their Part D premium, for life. Part A penalty exists but only applies to people who pay a Part A premium (those without sufficient work credits) — rare. Exceptions to the penalty: enrolled in employer group health coverage (through the person's or spouse's active employment), COBRA does NOT count as creditable coverage for Part B timing (a critical mistake — people on COBRA lose their Medicare enrollment window), TRICARE or VA coverage, creditable prescription coverage for Part D. A person with employer coverage has an 8-month Special Enrollment Period (SEP) after leaving the job or the coverage ends, whichever is first. Missing the SEP triggers the penalty. The General Enrollment Period (January-March) lets someone enroll late, with coverage starting the following month. IRMAA (Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount) is separate — higher-income beneficiaries pay more for Part B and D regardless of enrollment timing."

  example: {
    en: "After leaving his employer-sponsored health plan at age 68, Frank elected COBRA thinking it would bridge him until he was ready to enroll in Medicare. Fifteen months later his COBRA ended. When he enrolled in Part B, SSA told him COBRA is not creditable coverage for Part B purposes. His Part B premium was permanently increased by 10 percent — about $17 per month, or roughly $200 per year, for life. A HIICAP counseling session before choosing COBRA would have flagged this: Medicare enrollment within eight months of leaving active employment is the key deadline, and COBRA does not pause that clock."
