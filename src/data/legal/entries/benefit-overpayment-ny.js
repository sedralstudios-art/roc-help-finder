  title: { en: "NY Benefits Overpayment — How Recoupment Works When an Agency Says Benefits Were Overpaid" },

  summary: {
    en: "A benefits overpayment is when the local Department of Social Services determines a household received more SNAP, Temporary Assistance, or other aid than the household was entitled to. NY regulations at 18 NYCRR 387.19 (SNAP) and 18 NYCRR 352.31 (Temporary Assistance) set the recoupment rules. Collection happens by reducing current benefits, offsetting federal tax refunds, or direct repayment. The recipient has the right to a fair hearing, to a hardship reduction, and to challenge whether the claim is correct in the first place."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "An overpayment happens when the local social services district concludes a household received more benefits than the rules allowed. Common causes include an agency processing error, income or household changes not reported in time, and benefits that continued during a fair hearing when the final decision went against the recipient. Before any recoupment starts, the agency must send a written notice of the claim. Three categories of claim drive how the rules apply. Inadvertent household error means the household failed to report a change on time without intent. Administrative error means the agency made the mistake. Intentional program violation (IPV) means the household deliberately misrepresented facts to receive benefits not owed. The three categories carry different lookback periods, collection rates, and suspension thresholds. SNAP overpayment rules come from 18 NYCRR 387.19 and federal 7 CFR 273.18. For inadvertent and administrative error claims, the claim is calculated based on the overissuance during the 12 months preceding the date the mistake was discovered. For IPV claims, the claim is calculated retroactive to the month the violation occurred, but not more than 6 years back. Recoupment through benefit reduction is 10 percent of the household's monthly SNAP allotment or $10 per month, whichever is greater, for inadvertent or administrative error. For IPV, the rate rises to 20 percent of what the household would have received if not disqualified, or $10 per month, whichever is greater. The social services district may suspend collection on inadvertent or administrative error claims under $35 that cannot be recovered through benefit reduction. Adult household members at the time of the overissuance are jointly and severally liable for the full claim. Temporary Assistance overpayment rules come from 18 NYCRR 352.31(d). The district must take reasonable steps to recover overpayments, including those paid during a fair hearing that the recipient lost. Recoupment is set at 10 percent of the household's needs for Family Assistance and Safety Net Assistance. If undue hardship is claimed and substantiated, recoupment must not be less than 5 percent of the household's needs. When the grant itself is smaller than those thresholds, the full grant may be recouped. Collection methods beyond benefit reduction include direct repayment, withholding from unemployment compensation, recovering from federal pay, and intercepting federal tax refunds through the Treasury Offset Program. The agency may also pursue civil court action, particularly on IPV claims. Fair hearing rights apply to every overpayment notice. A request filed within 10 days of the notice usually preserves benefits at the current level (aid continuing) while the hearing is pending; requests filed within 60 days of the notice preserve the right to a hearing but not always to aid continuing. OTDA hearings handle the appeals. The Rochester-area hearing office is part of the Western Region. At the hearing, the household can challenge the calculation, the classification (IPV versus inadvertent), and the collection rate. Legal Aid Society of Rochester, LawNY, and Empire Justice Center represent low-income households in overpayment hearings. Documents that help a defense include the original notice, all benefit calculation worksheets from the agency, reporting history for the household, pay stubs and income records for the relevant period, and any correspondence about timely reported changes. Important nuance: an overpayment determination is not the same as a finding of fraud. Most overpayments are agency or inadvertent errors, and defending against the claim or negotiating a hardship reduction is routine legal aid work."

  example: {
    en: "Renee received a NY Temporary Assistance grant through Monroe County DHS. The agency sent a notice saying she had been overpaid $600 because she began a part-time job and did not report the income within the 10-day reporting window. The monthly grant was reduced by 10 percent to recover the balance under 18 NYCRR 352.31(d)(2). Renee contacted Legal Aid Society of Rochester. A caseworker filed a written undue-hardship request with DHS showing that monthly rent, utilities, and food expenses exceeded household income even before the recoupment. DHS agreed to reduce the recoupment to 5 percent of her household's needs. The smaller deduction let Renee keep working while the balance paid down over a longer period."
