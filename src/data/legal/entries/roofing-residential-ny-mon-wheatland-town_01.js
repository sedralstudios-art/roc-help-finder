  summary: {
    en: "The Town of Wheatland explicitly requires a building permit for roofs, decks, porches, and entryways of any size. If work begins without a permit, the Town can issue a Stop Work order with penalties of four times the permit cost plus $100. The Village of Scottsville, which sits inside the Town, has separate code enforcement."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Wheatland's Building Department website explicitly lists 'Roofs, decks, porches and entryways — any size' among the projects that require a building permit. The Town also requires permits for replacement of any project that originally required a permit, and all replacement projects must comply with current zoning and building code requirements. The Building Department and Fire Marshal conduct plan reviews and construction inspections. Property owners who start work without a required permit face a Stop Work order and penalties of four times the permit cost plus $100. The Village of Scottsville has a Historic District on Rochester Street — properties in that area may have additional requirements."
  },

  example: {
    en: "A homeowner in Wheatland needs a complete roof replacement. Because the Town explicitly lists roofs of any size as requiring a building permit, the homeowner contacts the Building Department before hiring a contractor. The contractor submits a permit application and waits for approval before starting work."
