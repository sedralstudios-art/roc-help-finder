    en: "Identity theft happens when someone uses your personal information to open accounts, borrow money, file taxes, get medical care, or commit crimes in your name. In New York, identity theft is a crime under Penal Law Article 190 (§ 190.77-190.84). Victims have the right to file a police report, place a security freeze on their credit (free under federal and state law), dispute fraudulent accounts, and get a copy of any application or transaction the thief made using their identity. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, credit bureaus must investigate disputes within 30 days and remove fraudulent information. The NY Attorney General's office also handles identity theft complaints and can intervene with companies that refuse to cooperate."
