Premiums range from free to 60 dollars a month per child depending on family income, capped at three children per family. Enrollment is year-round through NY State of Health."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Child Health Plus (CHPlus) is New York's version of the federal Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP, 42 USC 1397aa and following). It is authorized under NY Public Health Law Section 2511 and funded jointly by state and federal dollars. The program covers children under age 19 whose family income is too high for Medicaid but too low to afford private insurance. CHPlus covers doctor visits, hospital stays, prescription drugs, dental and vision care, mental health services, routine immunizations, and emergency care with no deductible and no copay for children. Pre-existing conditions are never a reason for denial. Premiums depend on family income. A family under 160 percent of the federal poverty level (roughly 50,000 dollars a year for a family of four in 2026) pays nothing. A family between 160 and 250 percent pays 9 dollars per child per month. A family between 250 and 400 percent pays 30 to 60 dollars per child per month. The premium caps at three children — a family of four or more children pays no more than three-child premiums. A family over 400 percent can still enroll but pays full premium without state subsidy (rarely worth it). Enrollment is year-round — there is no open enrollment window. Application is through NY State of Health at nystateofhealth.ny.gov or by phone at [number being verified]. A free certified Navigator can walk a family through the application in-person or by phone. Common Navigators in Monroe County include ABC Health Centers, the Monroe County Department of Human Services, and several community health centers. Children who qualify for Medicaid (family income under 138 percent of poverty for most children, higher for younger children) are routed to Medicaid automatically. The application is the same. Plans are administered by private insurers including Fidelis Care, MVP, Excellus BlueCross BlueShield, and YourCare Health Plan in the Monroe County region. The family picks the plan at enrollment. Benefits are the same across plans but provider networks differ. A child whose family income changes must report the change within 30 days — CHPlus may switch to Medicaid if income drops, or premium may increase or decrease as income changes. A child approaching 19 must renew under adult health insurance, usually through a parent plan or a Qualified Health Plan with income-based subsidies on NY State of Health. Immigration status does not affect CHPlus eligibility for the child under PHL 2511-b — an undocumented child in New York can still enroll and the family's immigration status is not reported to federal immigration authorities. Child Health Plus coverage also continues for children in foster care, children whose parents are incarcerated, and children in kinship care arrangements."

  example: {
    en: "The Medrano family has three children ages 4, 8, and 14 in Rochester. Parents earn 68,000 dollars a year as a restaurant cook and a home health aide, placing them at 235 percent of the federal poverty level for a family of five. Too high for Medicaid, too low for workplace insurance. They applied through NY State of Health and were approved for CHPlus at a premium of 9 dollars per child per month — 27 dollars total. Fidelis Care covered all three children starting the following month, including dental cleanings and vision exams for the school year."
