  title: { en: "Medicaid Buy-In for Working People With Disabilities — Keeping Coverage While Earning More" },

  summary: {
    en: "MBI-WPD lets a person with a disability work and earn above regular Medicaid income limits while keeping Medicaid coverage. The person pays a modest premium based on income. Earnings up to about $75,000 are allowed. Resource limits are higher than regular Medicaid. This program is critical for people whose employment would otherwise cost them Medicaid-funded home care or medications."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "The Medicaid Buy-In for Working People with Disabilities (MBI-WPD), authorized under New York Social Services Law Section 366(1)(a)(11) and implemented through 18 NYCRR Part 360, is a state pathway to Medicaid for people with disabilities who work. Regular Medicaid for adults with disabilities has strict income and resource limits — typically less than $20,000 in assets and income well below $20,000 per year for an individual. People on SSDI or private disability income often earn or save above those limits, or want to work and earn more, but lose Medicaid if they do. MBI-WPD solves this: the participant can earn up to about $75,000 (after exclusions) and have up to $20,000 ($30,000 for a couple) in non-exempt resources. In exchange, the participant pays a monthly premium based on countable income — the premium is capped at 7.5 percent of countable income over 150 percent of the federal poverty level, and can be $0 for many participants. The coverage is full Medicaid — medical, dental, vision, mental health, prescription drugs, home care, and long-term services and supports. Critically, people on MBI-WPD can access Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program (CDPAP) and other Medicaid home care. MBI-WPD has two groups: Basic (working but at or below 250 percent FPL) and Medical Improvement (for participants whose medical condition improved enough that they might lose SSDI, but who still have a disability and want to keep working). Applications are through the county DSS or through the NY State of Health marketplace. People already on SSI or SSDI can transition — they keep SSI resource exemption rules during the transition if applicable. The person must not have dependent children that would trigger a different Medicaid category. NY also has ABLE accounts (separate topic) that work alongside MBI-WPD by excluding disability-related savings from resource counts."

  example: {
    en: "A Rochester resident with a spinal cord injury received Medicaid home care through Consumer Directed Personal Assistance (CDPAP) while collecting SSDI. She accepted a part-time job paying $24 per hour — her combined SSDI and earnings exceeded regular Medicaid's income limit, threatening her CDPAP services. A WIPA counselor walked her through MBI-WPD. She enrolled and paid a small monthly premium based on her income. She kept full Medicaid coverage and her CDPAP hours unchanged. Her net take-home increased substantially without losing care."
