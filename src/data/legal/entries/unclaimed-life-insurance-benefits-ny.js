  summary: {
    en: "Many life insurance benefits go unclaimed because family members never know a policy existed. New York Insurance Law Section 3240 now requires insurers to search periodically for deaths and notify beneficiaries. The NYS Comptroller's Office of Unclaimed Funds holds millions of dollars in unclaimed life insurance proceeds. Both the insurer's records and the state database are free to search."

      "Any person handling a small estate where the decedent's financial records were incomplete.",

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Life insurance proceeds go unclaimed when the beneficiary does not know the policy exists and the insurer does not learn the insured has died. Under New York Insurance Law Section 3240 (enacted 2012), life insurance companies must periodically check the Social Security Administration Death Master File against their active policies and attempt to contact beneficiaries of policies matched. The law was a response to industry practice of holding proceeds for years after death. Since 2012 many previously unclaimed policies have been reunited with families. However, gaps remain — older policies, policies sold to reinsurance, and policies where the beneficiary changed addresses. NYS Comptroller's Office of Unclaimed Funds holds property turned over by insurers after they are unable to locate beneficiaries. Unclaimed property becomes state-held after three years of dormancy. The state holds the funds indefinitely — there is no time limit to claim. To search: visit osc.state.ny.us/unclaimed-funds and enter the deceased person's name. The search is free. Matches show the amount held, the company that reported it, and claim instructions. Multi-state search: the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators (NAUPA) runs missingmoney.com, a consolidated search across most state unclaimed-property databases. Life insurance policy locator services: the NAIC has a free Life Insurance Policy Locator at naic.org — submits an inquiry to participating insurers who check their records for the deceased's name. Typical response time 30 to 90 days. Private locator services charge a fee (often a percentage of recovered proceeds) — unnecessary since the free tools cover most cases. Claiming process: the beneficiary submits a claim form to the insurance company or the Office of Unclaimed Funds. Required documents typically include the death certificate, identification of the claimant, and proof of beneficiary status. Processing takes 4 to 12 weeks."

  example: {
    en: "A Rochester resident learned after her mother's death that her mother had mentioned life insurance years ago but left no paperwork. She searched osc.state.ny.us/unclaimed-funds with her mother's name and found nothing. She then used the NAIC Life Insurance Policy Locator, which sent an inquiry to participating insurers. Six weeks later, an insurer replied that yes, her mother had a $15,000 policy that had been paid to the state's unclaimed funds office two years earlier after the insurer's failed attempts to contact beneficiaries. She filed a claim with the state, provided the death certificate and her ID, and received the funds eight weeks later. She did not pay a finder's fee because the free tools produced the match."
