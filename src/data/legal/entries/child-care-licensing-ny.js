  summary: {
    en: "Child care providers in New York are grouped into license types based on the number of children and setting. Day care centers, group family day care homes, family day care homes, school-age child care, and legally-exempt providers each have different rules. Parents have the right to see inspection reports, file complaints, and know a provider's history before enrolling."

    en: [
      "Any parent choosing a child care provider who wants to understand licensing categories.",
      "Any parent with a concern about a licensed provider's practices.",
      "Any person interested in becoming a licensed child care provider.",
      "Any parent receiving a child care subsidy who needs to confirm the provider's eligibility."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "The New York Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) regulates child care under 18 NYCRR Parts 413-418. Each type has distinct rules. Day care centers (Part 418-1) serve 7 or more children in a non-residential setting — strictest staffing ratios, facility standards, and teacher qualifications. Small day care centers (Part 418-2) serve 3-6 children in a non-residential setting. Group family day care homes (Part 416) are residential, serving up to 12 children (with a required assistant). Family day care homes (Part 417) are residential, serving up to 6 children (or 8 with school-age children included). School-age child care (Part 414) serves children ages 5-12 before/after school. Legally-exempt care (Part 415) is care by a relative, in a child's own home, or in small informal arrangements — not licensed but eligible to receive child care subsidy payments with an enrollment form. Licensed providers are inspected at least once every two years (more often for complaints or violations). Inspection reports are public — parents can view them through OCFS's online portal or by request. Violations are categorized: serious violations (endangering health or safety), repeat violations, and minor infractions. Serious or unresolved violations can lead to suspension or revocation. In Monroe County, the Child Care Council runs the Child Care Resource and Referral (CCR&R) office that helps parents find licensed providers, explains subsidy eligibility, and can connect families to providers based on specific needs. Unlicensed care that exceeds the legally-exempt category (caring for more children than allowed, operating as a business without a license) is illegal. Background check requirements have tightened in recent years. Every licensed provider, every household member age 18 or older in a residential program, and every employee of a center must clear a state and federal fingerprint check, a check of the Statewide Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment, and a check of the sex offender registry. The fingerprint check is portable across NY child care employers, but expires periodically and must be renewed. Mandatory training requirements vary by license type — directors of larger centers complete more hours than family day care providers, but every license tier requires ongoing health, safety, and child development training. Subsidy reimbursement rates are set by the state and may be lower than the provider's private-pay rate; some providers charge subsidy families a gap fee to cover the difference, but that practice is restricted. Providers cannot turn away a subsidized family solely because of the subsidy, but they can charge what they would charge any private-pay family."

  example: {
    en: "A parent in Irondequoit was choosing between two family day care homes. She used the OCFS online lookup to check both providers' inspection history. One had two years of clean inspections. The other had been cited twice in the past year for staffing ratios and had an open corrective action plan. She chose the first provider and shared the inspection information with her neighbor, who also switched. The flagged provider later improved after the corrective action was completed — inspection records update continuously."
