  },

  summary: {
    en: "The Town of Greece requires a building permit for roof work only when the job involves replacing plywood or sheathing. Simple re-shingling over existing sound sheathing does not require a permit. Plumbers must be registered with the Town."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Greece takes a middle position on roofing permits. The Town's Building Department guidelines list 'replacing a roof that needs new plywood or sheathing' as requiring a permit, while simple re-roofing (shingle replacement over sound decking) is not listed among permit-required work. This means the permit requirement depends on the condition of the roof deck, not just whether the shingles are being replaced. Contractors should confirm the scope with the Building Department before starting if there is any uncertainty about whether sheathing will need replacement. The Town administers its own code under NYS Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code. Plumbing work requires a permit geted by a plumber registered with the Town of Greece."
  },

  example: {
    en: "A roofing contractor inspects a house in Greece and finds the shingles are worn but the plywood decking underneath is solid. The contractor can proceed with a tear-off and re-shingle without a Town permit. On the next job two streets over, the decking has water damage and needs partial replacement. That job requires a permit from the Building Department before work begins."
