  summary: {
    en: "New York sets the floor for residential electrical work — the building code (which includes the National Electrical Code), the rules for licensed inspection, and protections for workers. The NY twist most people don't know: towns don't inspect electrical themselves. Third-party agencies do."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Electrical work on homes in New York has to follow the NYS Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code, which includes the National Electrical Code (NEC, also known as NFPA 70). Paid electricians must carry workers comp insurance (pays medical bills if a worker gets hurt on the job) and disability coverage.\n\nThere is NO statewide electrician license in New York. Licensing is local — each city, town, or village sets its own rules. NYC has Master and Special Electrician licenses. Buffalo has its own Master Electrician license. The City of Rochester has its own Examining Board of Electricians with Master Three-Phase, Master Single-Phase, and Single-Phase Residential licenses. Most upstate towns don't license electricians at all — they just require a permit and inspection.\n\nThe NY way that's different from most states: **third-party Electrical Inspection Agencies**. Towns don't do electrical inspections themselves. Instead, each town approves a list of inspection agencies. The homeowner or electrician picks one from the list, the agency inspects the work, and the agency issues a Certificate of Compliance. Common agencies in Monroe County: NY Electrical Inspection Agency (NYEIA), Commonwealth Electrical Inspection Service, Middle Department Inspection Agency (MDIA). Other NY agencies include NY Board of Fire Underwriters (NYBFU) and Atlantic-Inland.\n\nIn most of upstate New York, a homeowner can do their own electrical work in their own single-family home. They still need a permit and inspection. NYC does NOT allow homeowner electrical work — only licensed electricians."

  example: {
    en: "A homeowner in a Monroe County suburb wants to add an EV charger (Level 2, 240V). In most towns, this needs a permit AND inspection. The homeowner files a permit at the Town Building Department, does the work (or hires a licensed electrician), then picks an approved Electrical Inspection Agency from the town's list. The agency inspects the work and issues a Certificate of Compliance. The town closes out the permit once the certificate comes in."
