  summary: {
    en: "In New York, every registered vehicle must have continuous insurance coverage. If insurance lapses — even for one day — the DMV will suspend the vehicle's registration and may suspend the owner's driver's license. Reinstating registration after a lapse requires proof of new insurance and payment of a civil penalty. The penalties increase with the length of the lapse."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Under New York Vehicle and Traffic Law Section 318, the insurance company must notify the DMV whenever a policy is cancelled or lapses. The DMV then sends a notice to the vehicle owner demanding proof of insurance within a set period. If the owner does not provide proof, the DMV suspends the vehicle registration. If the vehicle is driven with a suspended registration, the driver faces a traffic ticket, a fine, and possible impoundment of the vehicle. The civil penalties for a lapse are substantial. For a lapse of 1 to 30 days, the penalty is $8 per day. For 31 to 60 days, $12 per day. For 61 to 90 days, $17 per day. For over 90 days, $21 per day. These penalties add up fast — a 60-day lapse costs $600 or more. In addition to the civil penalty, the DMV can suspend the owner's driver's license for an uninsured vehicle (VTL Section 319). Reinstating the registration requires providing proof of new insurance (an FS-1 form filed electronically by the new insurer), paying the civil penalty, and paying a $25 registration revocation fee. When switching insurance carriers, there must be no gap between the old policy end date and the new policy start date — even one day triggers the DMV lapse process."

  yourRights: {
    en: [
      "A vehicle owner who receives a lapse notice has the right to respond with proof that coverage was continuous — if the insurer made an error, the lapse can be reversed.",
      "A vehicle owner has the right to contest the lapse if the insurance company failed to properly notify the DMV of continued coverage.",
      "A vehicle owner who cannot afford the civil penalty can request a payment plan from the DMV.",
      "If the vehicle was not driven during the lapse (it was stored, broken down, or parked), the owner can provide a sworn statement — but the registration suspension and penalty still apply unless the plates were surrendered before the lapse.",
      "To avoid a lapse when switching carriers, the new policy must start on or before the day the old policy ends.",
      "A vehicle owner can surrender the plates to the DMV before cancelling insurance — this avoids the lapse penalty."

  example: {
    en: "When switching car insurance carriers, Darnell's old policy ended on March 15 and his new policy started on March 17 — a 2-day gap. The old insurer notified the DMV of the cancellation. The DMV sent Darnell a lapse notice and suspended his registration. Darnell had to have his new insurer file an FS-1 form, pay a $16 civil penalty (2 days at $8/day), and pay a $25 revocation fee. Total cost for a 2-day gap: $41 plus the hassle. If Darnell had started the new policy on March 15, none of this would have happened."
