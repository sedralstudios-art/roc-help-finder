  summary: {
    en: "New York sets the floor for residential plumbing work — the building code, the public health rules for drinking water, and protections for workers. Towns and villages add their own rules on top, including who can pull a permit."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Plumbing work on one- and two-family homes in New York has to follow the NYS Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code. The state also has separate public health rules for drinking water safety (10 NYCRR Part 5). Paid plumbers must carry workers comp insurance (pays medical bills if a worker gets hurt on the job) and disability coverage. There is NO statewide plumber license in New York. Each city, town, or village decides who can pull a plumbing permit. Most of upstate — including Monroe County — lets a master plumber register with the town and then pull permits. NYC and some other cities have their own stricter licensing. In most of upstate, a homeowner can do plumbing in their OWN single-family home without hiring a licensed plumber. But they still have to pull a permit and pass an inspection. NYC is different — you generally can't do your own plumbing work there."
  },

  example: {
    en: "A homeowner in a Monroe County suburb wants to replace their water heater. In most towns, this needs a permit even though it seems simple. The homeowner goes to the Town Building Department, fills out a permit, and either hires a registered plumber or (in most upstate towns) pulls the permit themselves as a DIY homeowner. After the install, a town inspector checks the work. If the work passes, the homeowner gets a certificate of compliance."

      "Workers paid in cash, by check, or off the books — wage laws apply the same way",
