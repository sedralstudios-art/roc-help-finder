  title: { en: "Structured Settlement Transfers — Court Review Before Selling Future Payments" },

  summary: {
    en: "A structured settlement pays out over time — monthly checks or lump sums at set dates — often from a personal injury lawsuit or wrongful death case. Selling those future payments to a factoring company for a lump sum requires court approval under New York General Obligations Law Section 5-1701. The court reviews the fairness of the deal. Most transfers lose the seller a substantial portion of the payment value."

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Any person receiving a structured settlement (monthly or periodic payments from a prior lawsuit).",
      "Any person considering selling some or all future payments to a factoring company for cash now.",
      "Any person who already signed a transfer agreement but has not had the court approve it.",
      "Any family member concerned about a relative being pressured to transfer their settlement."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "A structured settlement is a negotiated payout that replaces a lump-sum judgment with scheduled future payments — usually through an annuity funded by the defendant's insurance. The idea is to protect the injured person (or family) from spending the money too quickly and to ensure income over time. A factoring company may approach the recipient offering a lump-sum payment in exchange for rights to future payments. The discount rate is typically harsh — a $100,000 stream of future payments might be bought for $45,000 to $60,000 now. Under General Obligations Law Section 5-1701 (the Structured Settlement Protection Act), a transfer of structured settlement payment rights is not legally effective without court approval. The court must find that the transfer is in the best interest of the payee (and any dependents) and complies with federal and state law. Federal tax consequences: Internal Revenue Code Section 5891 imposes a 40 percent excise tax on transfers that did not receive a qualified order — a strong incentive to get the court review. The application to the court includes: a copy of the transfer agreement, a disclosure statement showing the amounts, the discount rate, the effective interest rate, fees, and comparisons of the present value of future payments to the offer price. The court holds a hearing. The seller has the right to legal advice before the hearing (the factoring company sometimes pays for independent professional advice as part of the deal). The court considers the payee's financial situation, age, dependents, health, reasonable alternatives, the purpose of the transfer, and the fairness of the discount rate. If the purpose is a true emergency (medical bills, imminent eviction) or a one-time investment (buying a home), approval is more likely. If the purpose is discretionary spending, the court may deny approval. Serial transfers — selling payment streams repeatedly — are heavily scrutinized."

  example: {
    en: "A Rochester resident receiving a structured settlement of $2,200 per month for life (from a 10-year-old personal injury case) was approached by a factoring company offering $85,000 cash for 120 months of future payments. Present value of those 120 payments at a reasonable discount rate was closer to $200,000. The court hearing under General Obligations Law § 5-1701 examined the seller's financial situation, learned the $85,000 was intended for discretionary spending rather than a specific need, and denied the transfer as not in the seller's best interest. The seller kept the monthly payments. A later application to transfer a smaller amount ($20,000 for medical bills and vehicle repair) was approved."
