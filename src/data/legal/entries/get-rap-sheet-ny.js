  summary: {
    en: "A RAP sheet (Record of Arrest and Prosecution) is the official record of a person's criminal history in New York. Getting a copy helps with sealing applications, employment disputes, and understanding what background checks will show. The process is done by mail through the Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) and requires fingerprinting."

      "Anyone preparing a CPL § 160.59 sealing application needs to know what is on their record.",

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "The RAP sheet is maintained by the NY Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS). It shows every arrest, charge, and disposition (outcome) in New York. It may also include out-of-state convictions if they were reported to New York. Sealed and dismissed cases should NOT appear on the RAP sheet. If a sealed case does appear, that is an error that can be corrected. To request a copy, the person must be fingerprinted — the fingerprints are used to match the request to the correct record. The fingerprinting can be done at a local police station or at a facility that provides the service. The completed fingerprint card and a request form are mailed to DCJS. The RAP sheet is returned by mail directly to the person. Private background check companies (used by employers and landlords) pull from different databases and may show different information than the DCJS RAP sheet. If there is a discrepancy, the DCJS record is the official state record. Federal records are separate. The FBI maintains the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database, which compiles state criminal records from across the country. A federal background check (used for federal employment and some occupational licenses) pulls from NCIC. Requesting an FBI Identity History Summary (often called an FBI background check) is a separate process — the request goes to the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Division and requires a separate set of fingerprints. Information on a state RAP sheet that does not appear on the FBI summary may indicate the state did not report the case to NCIC, or vice versa. Accurate and complete record review before sealing applications, naturalization petitions, or employment background checks reduces surprises later. Sealing under CPL 160.59 hides most case information from public view but the case still exists in the records — DCJS, FBI, and law enforcement agencies can still see sealed cases for limited purposes."

  example: {
    en: "A woman in Rochester applies for a job and is told her background check shows an arrest from 15 years ago that was dismissed. She requests her RAP sheet from DCJS to see the official record. The RAP sheet confirms the case was dismissed and should be sealed. She contacts Legal Aid, which sends a correction request to DCJS and a dispute to the background check company. The dismissed case is removed from both records."
