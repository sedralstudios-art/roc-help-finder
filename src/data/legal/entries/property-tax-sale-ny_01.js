  summary: {
    en: "If property taxes go unpaid long enough, the county can place a tax lien on the property and eventually sell it at a tax foreclosure auction. In Monroe County, the process takes years — not months — and there are multiple chances to pay the debt and keep the home. Understanding the timeline and the options is critical for homeowners who are behind."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "When property taxes go unpaid in Monroe County, the county treasurer records a tax lien against the property. Interest and penalties accrue on the unpaid amount. After a period of years (the exact timeline varies — Monroe County typically allows 2-3 years of delinquency before initiating foreclosure), the county can file a tax foreclosure proceeding under RPTL Article 11. The homeowner receives notice and has a redemption period during which they can pay the full delinquent amount plus interest and penalties to cancel the lien and stop the foreclosure. If the redemption period passes without payment, the county takes title to the property and can sell it at auction. The homeowner loses the property and any equity in it. For many homeowners — especially seniors on fixed incomes and families going through financial hardship — the key is acting early. Payment plans, STAR exemptions, senior exemptions, and hardship reductions can prevent the situation from reaching foreclosure. The Monroe County Treasurer's office has information on payment plan options."

    en: "A retired homeowner in Gates falls behind on property taxes after a medical emergency. After two years of unpaid taxes, Monroe County files a tax foreclosure petition. The homeowner receives a notice with a redemption deadline. She contacts Legal Aid, which helps her apply for Enhanced STAR and a senior exemption (reducing future taxes) and negotiates a payment plan with the county treasurer for the delinquent amount. She pays the plan on time and keeps her home."
