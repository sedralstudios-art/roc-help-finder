  title: { en: "New York Estate Tax — The Cliff, the Exemption, and Who Actually Owes" },

  summary: {
    en: "New York imposes a state estate tax on estates above a threshold known as the basic exclusion amount, which is adjusted for inflation each year. Unlike the federal estate tax, New York has a cliff — estates just over the threshold lose the full exemption and pay tax on the entire amount, not just the excess. Planning matters for estates approaching the line. Most estates owe nothing. The current threshold is published at tax.ny.gov/bus/estate."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Under New York Tax Law Article 26 (Sections 951-963), estates of New York decedents with a gross estate value above the basic exclusion amount owe New York estate tax. The threshold rises each year with inflation. The current NY basic exclusion amount and the current federal estate tax threshold are at tax.ny.gov/bus/estate and irs.gov respectively. The two taxes are separate: an estate can owe NY tax without owing federal tax, because the federal threshold is significantly higher than the NY threshold. New York has a distinctive cliff: the exemption phases out completely between 100 percent and 105 percent of the basic exclusion amount. An estate at 100 percent of the threshold owes no tax. An estate at 105 percent or more loses the exemption entirely and owes tax on the full value from the first dollar — not just the excess. Rates run from 3.06 percent to 16 percent on a graduated schedule. Qualified portability between spouses is not available in New York (unlike federal law) — a surviving spouse cannot carry over an unused exemption from the first spouse to die. The gross estate includes real property, bank accounts, retirement accounts, life insurance proceeds on policies the decedent owned, business interests, and joint property. Charitable bequests are deductible. Bequests to a surviving spouse are fully deductible (marital deduction). Planning tools to stay under the cliff include lifetime gifts (NY has no gift tax but the federal annual exclusion matters), credit shelter trusts, charitable bequests, and insurance held in an irrevocable trust. The estate tax return (Form ET-706) is due nine months after death."

  example: {
    en: "A decedent's estate was valued just above the NY threshold in force on the date of death — high enough to push past the 105-percent cliff line. Because the estate cleared the cliff, the exemption was lost entirely and the estate owed NY estate tax on the full value of the estate. Had the decedent made a charitable bequest during lifetime or through the will large enough to bring the gross estate below the 105-percent line, the estate would have dropped under the cliff, saved a significant amount in NY tax, and delivered funds to a named charity. The family consulted an estate attorney after the fact; the cliff was the critical planning failure."
