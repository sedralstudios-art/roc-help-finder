  summary: {
    en: "Student loan debt affects millions of New Yorkers. Federal student loans have multiple repayment options including income-driven plans that cap payments based on what you earn, forgiveness programs for public service workers, and protections if you default. Private student loans have fewer options but are still subject to the statute of limitations. Understanding the difference between federal and private loans is the first step."

      "Anyone with federal student loan debt (Direct Loans, FFEL, Perkins) who is struggling to make payments.",
      "Anyone with private student loan debt who has been contacted by a collector or is in default.",
      "Public service workers (government employees, nonprofit employees, teachers, nurses, etc.) who may qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF).",
      "Anyone whose federal loans are in default — there are paths to get out of default and restore eligibility for income-driven repayment."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Federal and private student loans are different systems with different rules. Federal loans: income-driven repayment (IDR) plans cap monthly payments at a percentage of discretionary income. The main plans are SAVE (most generous for many borrowers), PAYE, IBR, and ICR. Payments can be as low as $0/month for very low-income borrowers. After 20-25 years of payments on an IDR plan, the remaining balance is forgiven. Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) forgives the remaining balance after 120 qualifying payments (10 years) for borrowers who work full-time for a qualifying public service employer. If federal loans are in default, options include loan rehabilitation (9 months of agreed payments to restore good standing) and consolidation. Private loans: these do not qualify for IDR or PSLF. If a private loan is in default, the lender can sue. In New York, the statute of limitations on private student loan debt is 6 years (CPLR § 213). If the lender sues after 6 years, the statute of limitations is a defense. Beware of student loan scams — legitimate federal programs are free. Anyone who charges a fee to help with federal loan programs is a scam."

  example: {
    en: "A single mother in Rochester has $35,000 in federal student loans from a degree she did not finish. She earns $28,000 per year and cannot afford the standard payment. She applies for the SAVE income-driven repayment plan at studentaid.gov. Her monthly payment drops from $350 to $45 based on her income. After 20 years of payments on the IDR plan, the remaining balance is forgiven. She pays nothing to enroll — the application is free."
