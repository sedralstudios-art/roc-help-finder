  summary: {
    en: "Chili has a unique setup. The town doesn't license electricians, but it DOES license the Electrical Inspection Agencies that operate inside Chili. Only agencies holding an annual Chili license can inspect electrical work here. Chapter 248 of the town code covers this."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Chili has a unique electrical rule. The town doesn't license individual electricians, BUT it does license the inspection agencies. Any agency that wants to inspect electrical work in Chili has to hold an annual license from the Chili Building Department. That's Chapter 248 of the town code (adopted 1985).\n\nBefore starting any electrical wiring, you have to file an application with the Electrical Inspector. You pick from the agencies that currently hold a Chili license. Call the Building Department at (585) 889-6143 to get the current licensed list.\n\nElectricity can't be turned on until the inspector issues a temporary certificate. The final Certificate of Compliance then goes to the town CEO, who issues the occupancy permit.\n\nChili also licenses plumbers (Chapter on plumbing licenses) — so Chili is unusual for running its own licensing program for both trades. Building permits are separate and go through CloudPermit.\n\nHomeowner self-work on electrical isn't explicitly addressed in the code sections we can read. Call the Building Department to confirm before doing DIY electrical."

  example: {
    en: "A Chili homeowner wants to install an EV charger. She calls the Chili Building Department to ask which inspection agencies currently hold a Chili license. The town gives her the list — she picks one. Her electrician files a permit and does the install. The licensed agency inspects. Only after the agency's final certificate does the town issue the occupancy sign-off."
