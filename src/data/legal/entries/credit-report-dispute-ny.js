  summary: {
    en: "Errors on credit reports are common — wrong accounts, debts already paid, accounts belonging to someone else, collections for the wrong amount, and leftover items from identity theft. The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA, 15 USC 1681) requires the three credit bureaus to investigate a written dispute within 30 days and to remove or correct inaccurate information. Checking a report and filing a dispute is free. New York adds a free security freeze and enforcement by the Attorney General. A consumer denied credit, housing, employment, or insurance because of a report is entitled to a free copy of that report."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "The Fair Credit Reporting Act is 15 USC 1681 and following. It governs the three big credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion — plus specialty bureaus that cover tenant screening, employment, and check-writing. New York adds a layer through General Business Law Article 25 (Fair Credit Reporting) that parallels the federal rules.\n\nFree reports. Every person is entitled to one free report from each of the three bureaus every year at annualcreditreport.com. The bureaus also offer free weekly reports through that same site. A consumer denied credit, housing, employment, or insurance because of a report is entitled to a free copy of that report on request to the bureau.\n\nThe dispute process. A written dispute can go to the bureau online, by mail, or by phone. Mail with return receipt is the strongest paper trail. The dispute identifies the item, explains what is wrong, and includes supporting documents (paid-in-full letters, court orders, identity theft reports, canceled checks). The bureau has 30 days (sometimes extended to 45) to investigate. The bureau contacts the company that reported the information — the 'furnisher' — and asks for verification. If the furnisher cannot verify, the item has to come off the report. The bureau has to send the results in writing.\n\nIf the dispute is denied. The consumer can add a 100-word statement to the report explaining their position. The statement shows up on every copy of the report going forward. A dispute that was denied on weak evidence can be refiled with stronger documentation.\n\nFurnisher duties. A furnisher (a bank, a debt collector, a utility) also has FCRA duties. Once the furnisher is on notice of a dispute, the furnisher has to investigate and correct errors. A furnisher that keeps reporting an item the consumer has already proven wrong can face a private lawsuit under 15 USC 1681s-2.\n\nSecurity freeze. New York law and federal law both give consumers the right to place a free security freeze at all three bureaus. A freeze stops new creditors from opening accounts in the consumer's name. The freeze can be lifted temporarily for a specific application and then re-placed. A child's credit can be frozen separately; each bureau has its own process for child freezes.\n\nAdverse action notices. When a creditor, landlord, employer, or insurer turns someone down based on a report, the decider has to send an 'adverse action' notice naming the bureau and explaining the right to a free copy of the report. The notice is the trigger to check what the report actually says.\n\nIdentity theft. A consumer who believes the error came from identity theft starts at identitytheft.gov. The FTC report there unlocks stronger rights — a full seven-year fraud alert, blocked accounts, and streamlined dispute procedures under 15 USC 1681c-2. See the identity-theft-ny entry.\n\nLawsuit remedies. A bureau or furnisher that fails to follow FCRA duties can be sued in federal or state court. Damages can include actual losses, statutory damages up to $1,000 for willful violations, punitive damages, and attorney's fees. Legal Aid programs and private consumer attorneys handle FCRA cases; many take them on contingent or statutory-fee arrangements.\n\nCommon errors to look for. Accounts from identity theft. Debts discharged in bankruptcy still showing as owed. Paid collections still reported as unpaid. Wrong balance or wrong last-payment date. Wrong payment history (a 30-day late that was on time). Accounts belonging to someone with a similar name or SSN. Medical debts that are supposed to be off the report (the big bureaus no longer report paid medical collections or balances under $500)."

  example: {
    en: "A woman in Rochester checks her credit report and finds a collection for $1,200 that she already paid two years ago. She gathers the payment confirmation and sends a dispute letter to all three credit bureaus by certified mail with the receipt attached. Within 25 days, two bureaus remove the collection. The third confirms it as accurate. She sends a second dispute with the payment receipt and a CFPB complaint number. The third bureau removes it within two weeks."
