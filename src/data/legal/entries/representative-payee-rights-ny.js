  summary: {
    en: "A representative payee is a person or organization appointed by Social Security to manage benefits for someone who cannot manage their own money — often a child, a person with a severe disability, or an elderly person with cognitive decline. The payee has a legal duty to use the money for the beneficiary's needs. Misusing the money is a federal crime."

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Any person whose Social Security or SSI benefits are managed by a representative payee.",
      "Any person who believes their representative payee is misusing their money.",
      "Any family member appointed as a representative payee who wants to understand the responsibilities.",
      "Any person who wants to manage their own benefits and have the representative payee removed."
    ]
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Under 42 USC Section 405(j), Social Security appoints a representative payee when a beneficiary is determined to be incapable of managing their own benefits. This includes minor children (a parent is usually the payee), adults with severe mental illness or intellectual disability, and elderly adults with dementia or cognitive impairment. The payee receives the benefits and must use them for the beneficiary's current needs — food, housing, clothing, medical care, and personal items. The payee must keep records of how the money is spent and file an annual accounting report with Social Security (Form SSA-6230). Money left over after meeting current needs must be saved for the beneficiary — it cannot be used for the payee's own expenses. A payee who steals or misuses benefits can be charged with a federal crime and required to repay the money. A beneficiary who disagrees with having a payee can request a review. If the beneficiary can show they are capable of managing their own money (with medical evidence or other documentation), Social Security can remove the payee. An organizational payee (like a social service agency) charges a fee for its services — currently up to $47 per month for SSI or $92 for Social Security. An individual payee (family member, friend) cannot charge a fee."

      "A representative payee must use benefits only for the beneficiary's current needs — not for the payee's own expenses.",
      "A representative payee must file an annual accounting report showing how benefits were spent.",
      "A beneficiary who believes the payee is misusing funds can report it to Social Security, the Office of the Inspector General, or Adult Protective Services.",
      "An individual payee (family member) cannot charge a fee for being the payee.",
      "A beneficiary has the right to appeal any Social Security decision about payee appointment."

  example: {
    en: "James, 32, has a mental health disability and receives SSI. His mother was appointed as his representative payee. After years of treatment and stability, James got a part-time job and wanted to manage his own benefits. He asked his psychiatrist for a letter stating he was capable of managing his finances. He brought the letter to the Rochester Social Security office and requested a review. Social Security removed the payee designation. James now receives his SSI directly and manages his own budget."
