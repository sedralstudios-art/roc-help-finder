  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Gates requires a separate electrical permit for electrical work. It's applied for through the town Building Department.\n\nInspection is done by one of three town-approved third-party Electrical Inspection Agencies. NY Electrical Inspection Agency (NYEIA) is explicitly listed on the town's approved-inspectors page. The other two are very likely MDIA (Middle Department) and Commonwealth — the standard Rochester-area set — but call the Building Inspector at [number being verified] to confirm the current list.\n\nGates licenses plumbers (Chapter 143) but does NOT have its own electrician license. The town likely accepts electricians holding a valid local license (e.g., Rochester). Homeowner self-work rules aren't posted — call to confirm.\n\nWhat gets inspected on a typical residential job: rough-in inspection after wiring is run but before drywall closes the walls, then a final inspection after fixtures, outlets, switches, and the panel are connected. Each inspection produces a deficiency report if anything fails code; the electrician corrects the deficiencies and requests a re-inspection. The inspection agency's fee is paid directly to the agency, separate from the town building permit fee. Typical residential inspection fees in Gates run $150 to $400 depending on the scope. The Certificate of Compliance is a permanent document that follows the property; future buyers may want to see it as evidence the work was permitted and inspected. Unpermitted electrical work discovered during a home sale can derail or delay closing because most lenders require the seller to address open code issues before the loan can close. Common residential projects that trigger an electrical permit in Gates include adding a new circuit, replacing the panel, installing an EV charger, wiring a hot tub or pool, finishing a basement with new outlets and lighting, and any work involving the service entrance or main disconnect. Like-for-like replacement of a fixture or a single outlet generally does not require a permit."

  example: {
    en: "A Gates homeowner wants to install a whole-house generator. He calls the Building Dept to confirm the approved agency list. He files the electrical permit with the town. His electrician does the generator install with the automatic transfer switch. NYEIA inspects and issues the Certificate of Compliance. The town closes out the permit."
