  title: { en: "Security Deposit Interest — When a Landlord Must Pay Interest on the Deposit" },

  summary: {
    en: "In buildings with six or more units, New York law requires the landlord to put the security deposit in an interest-bearing account and share the interest with the tenant. The landlord can keep a 1 percent administrative fee. For smaller buildings, interest is not required by state law. Tenants often do not know about this right — unclaimed interest adds up over a long tenancy."

      "Any tenant in a building with six or more residential units who paid a security deposit.",
      "Any tenant who has lived in a six-plus unit building for a year or more and has never received interest credits or payments.",
      "Any tenant whose deposit refund at the end of the lease did not include accrued interest.",
      "Any landlord of a six-plus unit building who wants to understand their obligation."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Under New York General Obligations Law Section 7-103, a security deposit is the tenant's money — the landlord holds it in trust. In buildings with six or more residential units, the landlord must deposit it in an interest-bearing bank account in New York and notify the tenant of the bank's name and address. The landlord must pay the tenant the interest earned, minus an administrative fee equal to 1 percent per year of the deposit. The landlord has three options for how to deliver interest: credit it against rent, pay it to the tenant annually, or include it with the deposit refund at the end of the tenancy. For buildings with fewer than six residential units, the state statute does not require interest — the deposit can be held in a non-interest-bearing account unless the lease says otherwise. The deposit cannot be commingled with the landlord's personal funds regardless of building size (commingling can make the full deposit the tenant's to recover). When a property is sold, the deposit must be transferred to the new owner with notice to the tenant. A landlord who fails to provide the required interest or notice has commingled the deposit in violation of Section 7-103 — the tenant may have a claim for the full deposit plus interest at the end of the lease. The separate deposit-return rules (General Obligations Law Section 7-108) set the 14-day return deadline, permitted deductions, and itemized statement requirement."

  example: {
    en: "A tenant in a Rochester apartment building with 48 units paid a $1,200 security deposit. After five years, the landlord returned the deposit but included no interest. The tenant sent a written demand citing General Obligations Law § 7-103. The landlord responded that the deposit had been held in an interest-bearing account earning about 2.5 percent annually for the last three years. The total interest over five years came to approximately $135. The landlord deducted the 1 percent annual administrative fee ($60) and paid the tenant the remaining $75."
