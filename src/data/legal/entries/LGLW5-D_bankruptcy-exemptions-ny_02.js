  summary: {
    en: "When you file bankruptcy in New York, exemptions protect your most important property. You choose between New York state exemptions and federal bankruptcy exemptions — whichever set protects more."
  },

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Anyone filing Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy in New York",
      "You must have lived in New York for at least 2 years (730 days) to use New York or federal exemptions",
      "If you moved to New York within the past 2 years, your prior state's exemptions may apply",
      "You must choose one set of exemptions — you cannot mix and match between them"
    ]
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Each state has its own exemptions, and the federal bankruptcy code has a separate set. New York has not opted out, so filers get to choose which set to use. The federal set offers a smaller homestead exemption but includes a flexible wildcard that can protect cash, bank accounts, and other property. Most filers without significant home equity benefit from choosing the federal exemptions."
  },

  yourRights: {
    en: [
      "You have the right to choose between New York state exemptions (CPLR §§ 5205–5206) and federal exemptions (11 U.S.C. § 522(d)).",
      "Qualified retirement accounts — 401(k)s, ERISA pensions, and most IRAs — are fully exempt under both sets with no dollar limit.",
      "Exempt property cannot be taken by a bankruptcy trustee to pay unsecured creditors.",
      "If your home equity is below the homestead exemption cap for your area, your home is fully protected.",
      "Social Security proceeds are fully exempt under federal law as long as they are not mixed with other funds."

  legalOptions: {

      "Current New York exemption amounts are available from the NY Department of Financial Services at dfs.ny.gov.",
      "A full 50-state exemption comparison is available at justia.com/bankruptcy/exemptions/bankruptcy-exemptions-50-state-survey/.",
      "Exemption amounts change periodically with inflation adjustments. Published figures may not reflect the most recent updates.",

  example: {
    en: "Lisa owns a home in Rochester with $85,000 in equity and a 401(k) worth $45,000. She owes $28,000 in credit card debt and files Chapter 7. Her home equity is fully protected by New York's homestead exemption for her area. Her 401(k) is 100% exempt — no trustee can touch it. There is nothing to liquidate. Her credit card debt is discharged. She keeps everything she owned."
