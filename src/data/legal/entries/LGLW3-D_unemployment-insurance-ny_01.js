  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Unemployment insurance provides temporary weekly payments to help replace lost income while you search for new work. The program is run by the New York State Department of Labor and funded by employer taxes. Your weekly benefit amount depends on how much you earned before becoming unemployed. In October 2025, New York increased the maximum weekly benefit from $504 to $869. Not everyone receives the maximum — your actual amount is based on your earnings history. Benefits are available for up to 26 weeks in a one-year period. There is one unpaid waiting week at the start of a new claim before payments begin. You must certify for benefits every week by confirming that you are still unemployed and actively looking for work. You must complete at least three work search activities per week. The Department of Labor has an online calculator at dol.ny.gov that can estimate your weekly benefit amount."

  example: {
    en: "Kevin worked at a manufacturing plant in Genesee County for eight years. The plant closed and he was laid off. He filed an unemployment insurance claim online at dol.ny.gov during his first week without work. After the one-week unpaid waiting period, he began receiving weekly payments based on his prior earnings. He certified for benefits each week and completed his required work search activities. He found a new job after 14 weeks and stopped certifying."
