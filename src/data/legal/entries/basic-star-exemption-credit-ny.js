  summary: {
    en: "Basic STAR is New York's School Tax Relief program. Homeowners whose income is at or below 500,000 dollars and who use the property as the primary residence qualify. The average Basic STAR savings in Monroe County is around 550 dollars a year, paid as a direct check from NY or as a reduction on the school tax bill. Enhanced STAR for seniors is separate."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "New York's Basic School Tax Relief (Basic STAR) program, at Real Property Tax Law Section 425, reduces school property taxes for most NY homeowners. The program covers roughly 2.6 million homeowners statewide. Income eligibility is 500,000 dollars or less in combined household income. Income is calculated as prior-year federal adjusted gross income minus the taxable portion of IRA distributions as reported on the NY tax return. A single homeowner earning 100,000 dollars qualifies; a household with two earners totaling 480,000 dollars qualifies; a household over 500,000 dollars does not. A property must be a primary residence — rentals, investment properties, second homes, and commercial property do not qualify. Basic STAR comes in two forms depending on when the homeowner registered. A homeowner who first got STAR before August 1, 2015 receives it as an exemption — the school tax bill shows a reduced assessed value, and the homeowner pays less on the bill. A homeowner who bought a home or first registered after that date receives it as the STAR credit — the homeowner pays the full school tax bill, and NY State mails a direct check (or direct deposit) for the same amount a few months later. The dollar amount is approximately equal, with a modest inflation increase each year for the credit version. In Monroe County, the average Basic STAR savings is around 550 dollars per year. Savings vary by school district (Pittsford, Penfield, Brighton typically have higher property tax rates so higher STAR savings; rural districts lower) and by assessed home value. Homeowners register through the NY State Tax Department at tax.ny.gov/star, by phone at [number being verified], or by paper Form RP-425-GC. Registration is a one-time action — once registered, STAR continues automatically as long as the homeowner still qualifies. The state verifies income annually by matching tax records. A homeowner whose income goes above 500,000 dollars loses Basic STAR; a homeowner whose income drops back below the threshold is automatically re-enrolled. Enhanced STAR (for homeowners 65 and older with income at or below 110,750 dollars for the 2026 benefit year) is a separate higher benefit and is covered in its own program — see star-senior-exemption-ny. A homeowner cannot claim both Basic and Enhanced STAR on the same home in the same year. Married couples filing jointly with one spouse 65 and meeting income requirements get Enhanced. Married couples where neither spouse is 65 get Basic. Enhanced STAR saves roughly 3 to 4 times more than Basic STAR. A Monroe County homeowner who just bought a home should register for STAR immediately after closing — the STAR credit check usually arrives several months after registration confirming the first school tax year. A homeowner denied STAR for income can appeal through the NY State Tax Department by providing tax returns and income documentation. STAR does not affect other property tax exemptions — it stacks with the Veterans exemption, Senior Citizen exemption (RPTL 467, different from Enhanced STAR), and the Disability exemption. A homeowner can check current STAR status and expected savings at tax.ny.gov/star. Town assessors in Greece, Brighton, Irondequoit, Penfield, Pittsford, Henrietta, Chili, and Rochester can also confirm local STAR records and savings estimates."

    en: "Leticia bought a home in Greece in 2023 for 245,000 dollars. Her household income from her teaching job and her husband's delivery job was 94,000 dollars. She registered for Basic STAR online at tax.ny.gov/star in October 2023. In September 2024, she received a Basic STAR credit check from NY State for 540 dollars covering the first full school year. The same check arrives each September thereafter automatically. She did not need to reapply."
