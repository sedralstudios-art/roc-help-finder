  example: {
    en: "Andre works at a restaurant in Monroe County. His employer pays him $9.00 per hour and tells him tips make up the difference. Andre learns that the minimum cash wage for tipped food service workers in upstate New York is $10.70 per hour as of 2026 — higher than what he is receiving. He contacts the Department of Labor at 1-888-469-7365. An investigator reviews his pay records and confirms the underpayment. The DOL orders his employer to pay Andre the wages owed plus liquidated damages."
