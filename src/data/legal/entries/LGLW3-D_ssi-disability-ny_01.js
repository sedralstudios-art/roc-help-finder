  summary: {
    en: "SSI stands for Supplemental Security Income. It's a monthly check for people with very little income and savings. It's for people 65 or older, blind, or with a disability. No work history is needed. New York adds its own bonus on top of the federal check."

      "Adults 65 and older with low income and savings.",
      "Adults of any age who are blind or have a disability that keeps them from working. The disability has to last at least 12 months or end in death.",
      "Children under 18 with a serious physical or mental condition that affects daily life.",

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "SSI is a federal program run by the Social Security Administration. It gives you a monthly check to help pay for food, clothing, and a place to live.\n\nThe monthly check goes up a little each year to keep up with prices. New York adds its own extra check on top — called the State Supplement (SSP). Your total amount depends on your income, where you live, and who lives with you.\n\nSavings that count include cash, bank accounts, and some property. Your home, one car, and your personal things usually don't count.\n\nIn New York, if you get SSI, you automatically get Medicaid. You also automatically qualify on the income side for SNAP.\n\nCurrent amounts, savings limits, and income rules are at ssa.gov."

      "You have the right to keep getting benefits during the appeal — if you file the appeal on time.",

  example: {
    en: "Marcus is 41. He has a spinal condition that keeps him from working. He has never worked long enough to qualify for SSDI. He applied for SSI at his local Social Security office. After turning in medical records and doing an interview, he was approved. Now he gets a monthly SSI check plus the New York State Supplement. He got Medicaid automatically and was approved for SNAP without a separate application."
