  title: { en: "Alimony Modification — Changing Spousal Support After a Job Loss, Retirement, or Remarriage" },

  summary: {
    en: "Spousal support (maintenance) can be modified if there is a substantial change in circumstances — like a job loss, retirement, disability, or the receiving spouse's remarriage or cohabitation. Either spouse can file a modification petition. The court looks at whether the change is significant enough to justify adjusting the amount or duration."

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Any person paying spousal support who lost a job, became disabled, or retired.",
      "Any person paying support whose ex-spouse remarried or is living with a new partner.",
      "Any person receiving support whose ex-spouse's income increased significantly.",
      "Any person whose spousal support order is based on income they no longer earn."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Under New York Domestic Relations Law Section 236(B)(9)(b), a court can modify a spousal maintenance order if there has been a substantial change in circumstances since the original order. Changes that can justify modification include the paying spouse lost a job involuntarily or became disabled, the paying spouse retired at a reasonable age, the receiving spouse remarried (maintenance automatically terminates upon remarriage unless the agreement says otherwise), the receiving spouse is cohabiting with another person in a relationship that is substantially similar to marriage, either spouse's income changed significantly, and the original order was based on incorrect information. A modification petition is filed in the court that issued the original order — usually Supreme Court for divorce matters. The burden is on the person requesting the modification to prove the change in circumstances. The modification takes effect from the date the petition is filed, not from the date of the change — filing quickly limits the exposure. A maintenance order can also include a built-in termination date. If the order already has an end date, it terminates automatically unless extended by the court. Cohabitation modifications are particularly fact-intensive in NY courts. The factor the judge weighs is whether the new relationship is functionally equivalent to marriage — shared finances, joint household expenses, holding out as a couple — not just whether the receiving spouse and a partner share an address. A receiving spouse who has a roommate is generally not cohabiting in the legal sense. Retirement-based modifications also depend on age and industry norms; a paying spouse who retires at 55 from a job typical of late-50s retirement may face skepticism, while retirement at 67 from a normal-retirement-age job is generally accepted. Voluntary income reductions — quitting a high-paying job for a lower-paying one without a strong reason — generally do not justify modification because the court can impute the prior earning capacity. Documentation of the change matters as much as the change itself."

  example: {
    en: "After paying $1,200 per month in spousal maintenance for 5 years, Robert was laid off from his manufacturing job. His income dropped from $65,000 to unemployment benefits of $24,000 annualized. Robert filed a modification petition in Monroe County Supreme Court within two weeks of the layoff. He presented his termination letter and unemployment benefit statement. The court reduced maintenance to $400 per month until Robert found comparable employment. The reduction was effective from the date Robert filed the petition."
