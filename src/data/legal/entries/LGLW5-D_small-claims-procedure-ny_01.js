  summary: {
    en: "Small claims court is designed for people to handle money disputes themselves, without a lawyer. The limit is $5,000 outside New York City (or $10,000 inside NYC). Filing fees are low, the process is simplified, and most cases are decided in a single hearing. Common cases include unpaid debts, security deposit disputes, property damage, and breach of contract."

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Any individual 18 or older who is owed money and the amount is $5,000 or less (outside NYC) or $10,000 or less (inside NYC).",
      "The case must be filed in the city, town, or village court where the person or business you are suing lives or does business.",
      "Businesses and sole proprietors can file in small claims. Corporations use a related 'commercial claims' part."
    ]

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Small claims court is a fast, low-cost way to resolve money disputes. You file a claim at the clerk's office of your local city, town, or village court. The filing fee is typically $10 to $20. The clerk schedules a hearing, usually within a few weeks. Both sides show up, present evidence (receipts, photos, texts, contracts, witnesses), and the judge makes a decision — often the same day. Lawyers are not required and most people do not bring one. If you win, you get a judgment — but collecting on it is a separate step. The losing side does not have an automatic right to appeal in small claims (only the defendant can appeal, and only on limited grounds). If you lose, your options are limited."

  yourRights: {
    en: [
      "You have the right to file a small claims case without a lawyer.",
      "You have the right to present evidence, call witnesses, and question the other side's witnesses.",
      "You have the right to request an adjournment if you need more time (the judge decides).",
      "You have the right to a written judgment explaining the decision.",
      "If you are the defendant and lose, you have the right to appeal to the county court within 30 days."

      "Bring identification, the other party's name and address, and a brief description of what happened and how much you are owed. The clerk will help you fill out the form.",
      "Filing fees: typically $10-$20 depending on the court and the amount claimed. An additional fee may apply for service by mail or in person.",
      "At the hearing, bring ALL evidence: contracts, receipts, invoices, photos, texts, emails, and any witnesses. Organize it clearly — the judge sees many cases in one session.",

  example: {
    en: "Sarah's landlord in Irondequoit kept $800 of her $1,000 security deposit without any itemized list of deductions. She goes to the Irondequoit Town Court clerk's office, fills out a small claims form for $1,000 (the full deposit), and pays the $10 filing fee. Two weeks later, both sides appear. Sarah brings her lease, move-in photos, move-out photos, and the deposit receipt. The landlord has no receipts for the claimed damage. The judge awards Sarah the full $1,000. The landlord pays within 30 days."
