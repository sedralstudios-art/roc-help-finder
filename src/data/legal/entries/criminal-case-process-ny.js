  whatItMeans: {
    en: "The NY Criminal Procedure Law, enacted May 20, 1970 as Chapter 11-A of the Consolidated Laws, governs criminal cases statewide. CPL Article 10 lists the criminal courts, CPL Article 20 sets geographical jurisdiction, and CPL Article 30 sets speedy-trial timing. Most cases begin with an arrest under CPL Article 140 or a desk appearance ticket under CPL Article 150. An arrest without a warrant requires probable cause. Following arrest the defendant is arraigned in the local criminal court of the jurisdiction — in Monroe County, Rochester City Court for arrests within city limits or the respective town or village justice court elsewhere. At arraignment under CPL Article 170, the court reads the accusatory instrument, advises the defendant of the right to counsel, assigns counsel if requested and the defendant is eligible, takes a plea (typically not guilty), and addresses release under the CPL Article 500 bail rules. If the initial charge is a felony, the case may proceed to a felony hearing under CPL Article 180 or be presented to a grand jury under CPL Article 190. A grand jury consists of between 16 and 23 people and votes an indictment when the prosecution presents sufficient evidence. The grand jury standard is reasonable cause to believe the defendant committed the charged offense. Once indicted under CPL Article 200, the case is transferred to superior court — Monroe County Court or NY State Supreme Court — for arraignment on the indictment. Discovery in NY has been governed since January 1, 2020 by CPL Article 245, which replaced the narrower former Article 240. CPL Article 245 requires the prosecution to turn over most evidence within 20 days of arraignment in many cases, with certain longer or shorter deadlines depending on custody status. Pretrial motions follow under CPL Article 255 — typically motions to dismiss under Criminal Procedure Law § 170.30 (misdemeanor) or § 210.20 (felony), motions to suppress evidence, and motions challenging the accusatory instrument. Plea negotiations may proceed at any stage after discovery. An adjournment in contemplation of dismissal (ACD) under Criminal Procedure Law § 170.55 (general) or § 170.56 (marijuana) is an option for many misdemeanors — the case is adjourned for six months to a year and dismissed if no new arrest occurs. If the case goes to trial, CPL Article 260-280 governs jury selection and presentation. A NY felony jury has 12 members; a misdemeanor jury has 6 members unless the charge authorizes a greater sentence. The prosecution must prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt under CPL Article 70. A not-guilty verdict results in automatic sealing of the record under Criminal Procedure Law § 160.50. A guilty verdict or plea moves the case to sentencing under CPL Articles 380-400. Post-judgment motions under CPL Article 440 (vacating judgment or setting aside sentence) are filed in the sentencing court and may proceed in parallel with a direct appeal. Appeals from a judgment of conviction proceed under CPL Articles 450 and 460 — the direct-appeal entry covers that pathway in detail. Throughout the process, defendants have the constitutional right to counsel; Monroe County Public Defender and the 18-B Assigned Counsel Panel provide representation when a defendant cannot afford private counsel."

  example: {
    en: "Marcus is arrested in Rochester for a Class A misdemeanor petit larceny and released the same day with an appearance ticket. The next morning at Rochester City Court he is arraigned under CPL Article 170. The court assigns a public defender. The defender enters a not-guilty plea and asks for release on recognizance, which the court grants under CPL Article 500. Over the next 20 days, the District Attorney turns over discovery under CPL Article 245 — store security video and a witness statement. The public defender reviews the evidence and negotiates an ACD under Criminal Procedure Law § 170.55. Marcus stays out of trouble for six months, the case is dismissed, and the record is sealed under Criminal Procedure Law § 160.50."
