  summary: {
    en: "If a contractor, subcontractor, or material supplier is not paid for work on a property, they can file a mechanic's lien against the property. The lien attaches to the real estate — not the homeowner personally — and can block the sale or refinancing of the home until resolved. Homeowners sometimes discover a lien they did not know about, filed by a subcontractor the general contractor did not pay. Understanding how liens work — and how to discharge them — protects the homeowner."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Under Lien Law § 3, any contractor, subcontractor, laborer, or material supplier who performs work or provides materials for the improvement of real property can file a mechanic's lien if they are not paid. The lien must be filed within 8 months of the last date work was performed (4 months for single-family homes in most cases). The lien is filed with the county clerk and attaches to the property. It does not create a debt against the homeowner personally — but it clouds the title and can prevent sale or refinancing until resolved. For homeowners who paid the general contractor: if the GC did not pay a subcontractor and the sub files a lien, the homeowner may have to pay twice — once to the GC and once to discharge the lien. This is why paying by check (creating a paper trail) and requiring lien waivers from subs before making final payment to the GC is important. To discharge a lien: the homeowner can pay the lien amount, negotiate a reduction, file a bond to substitute for the lien (Lien Law § 19), or challenge the lien in court if it is invalid (wrong property, no work performed, filed too late). A lien expires 1 year after filing unless the lien holder extends it or files a lawsuit to foreclose."

  example: {
    en: "A homeowner in Irondequoit hires a general contractor to renovate a bathroom. She pays the GC $15,000 in full. The GC does not pay the plumber. The plumber files a mechanic's lien against the homeowner's property for $4,000. The homeowner discovers the lien when she tries to refinance. She contacts the GC, who refuses to pay the plumber. She files a bond to clear the lien from the title and then sues the GC to recover the $4,000 she has to pay to resolve the lien."
