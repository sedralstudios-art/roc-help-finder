  whatItMeans: {
    en: "NY Penal Law Article 156, enacted in 1986 and updated several times, is NY's primary state-level computer-crime statute. It operates alongside the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA, 18 USC 1030) — prosecutors may use either or both depending on jurisdiction and severity. Key definitions (Penal Law § 156.00): 'computer' — any programmable electronic device. 'computer program' — a series of instructions that can be executed by a computer. 'computer material' — any item of equipment, storage medium, or data. 'authorized use' — use by a person with authority granted by the owner. Unauthorized use of a computer (Penal Law § 156.05): a person knowingly uses or causes to be used a computer without authorization. Class A misdemeanor — up to 1 year jail, up to $1,000 fine. Computer trespass (Penal Law § 156.10): unauthorized use with intent to commit or attempt or further the commission of a felony. Class E felony — up to 4 years prison. Computer tampering degrees: (1) Fourth degree (156.20) — intentional alteration or destruction of computer material without authorization. Class A misdemeanor. (2) Third degree (156.25) — tampering with intent to commit a felony. Class E felony. (3) Second degree (156.26) — tampering causing damage over $3,000. Class D felony. (4) First degree (156.27) — tampering causing damage over $50,000. Class C felony — up to 15 years. Unlawful duplication of computer material (Penal Law § 156.30): copying or reproducing computer material worth over $2,500 without authorization. Class E felony. Criminal possession of computer material (Penal Law § 156.35): possessing unlawfully-duplicated material with knowledge of its origin. Class E felony. Unauthorized use with intent to commit another crime (Penal Law § 156.50): broader catch-all. Intent element: most Article 156 offenses require proof of intent — either specific intent to commit another offense (trespass, third-degree tampering) or general intent to access without authorization. Mistake or inadvertent access is typically not criminal, though civil liability may attach. Civil parallel (General Business Law 349, common-law conversion): victims can sue for actual damages, injunctive relief, and in some cases statutory damages under GBL 349. Common-law conversion and trespass to chattels also apply. Federal CFAA parallel (18 USC 1030): broader federal statute covering computers connected to interstate commerce. Federal prosecution typical for cross-state or cross-border offenses, high-damage cases, or cases involving federal computers. Prosecution priorities: NY DAs typically pursue Article 156 charges for (1) ransomware and extortion schemes, (2) business email compromise and wire fraud involving computer access, (3) insider employee data theft, (4) identity theft involving computer systems, (5) critical infrastructure attacks. Prosecution of small-scale access (e.g., a scorned ex logging into a spouse's Facebook) varies by jurisdiction. Investigation resources: NY Attorney General Internet and Technology Bureau, Monroe County DA Cyber Crime Unit (if exists), NYS Police Computer Crimes Unit. Federal cases go to FBI or Secret Service. Evidence preservation: critical in computer crime cases. Log files, backup drives, email metadata, and timestamps deteriorate quickly. Victims should immediately (1) preserve affected systems without modifying them, (2) document access logs, (3) contact IT forensics professionals, (4) report to law enforcement promptly, (5) consult counsel on civil discovery preservation. Defense considerations: common defenses include (1) authorized use — defendant had actual or apparent authority, (2) mistake — access was inadvertent, (3) lack of knowledge that access was unauthorized, (4) insufficient damage amount for higher-degree charges, (5) constitutional defenses (Fourth Amendment for law enforcement computer searches; First Amendment for speech-related access). Civil settlement: many business computer crime cases resolve civilly. Criminal restitution can be part of sentencing if convicted. Employee termination with agreed-upon release of claims is common in insider cases."

  example: {
    en: "A Rochester small business discovered that a former IT contractor had retained remote-access credentials after his contract ended and was accessing the company's customer database for 4 months. Company forensics identified approximately 8,000 customer records exfiltrated. The business reported to Monroe County DA Cyber Unit and NYS Attorney General. Charges: Computer Trespass (Penal Law § 156.10, E felony) and Unlawful Duplication (Penal Law § 156.30, E felony). Parallel federal investigation by FBI charged CFAA violations. State case pled guilty to first-degree tampering (Penal Law § 156.27, C felony) with 2-5 years prison and $75,000 restitution. Civil case by the business recovered additional $420,000 in damages and injunctive relief barring further contact. Federal charges deferred pending state disposition."
