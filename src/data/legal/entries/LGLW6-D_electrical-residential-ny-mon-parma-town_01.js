  summary: {
    en: "Parma handles electrical permits through its Building Department. A third-party inspection agency inspects — NYEIA is confirmed. The Village of Hilton is inside Parma but has its own Building Department. Check which jurisdiction your address falls in before filing."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "The Parma Building Department issues electrical permits for properties in Parma outside the Village of Hilton. Town inspectors handle building plan review; electrical inspection is done by a third-party agency.\n\nNYEIA is confirmed as an approved inspection agency for Parma. Other agencies (MDIA, Commonwealth) are likely also approved but call (585) 392-9449 to confirm the current list.\n\nParma doesn't license electricians. Whether the town formally accepts a Rochester Examining Board license isn't published.\n\nIMPORTANT: The Village of Hilton is inside Parma but has its own Building Department. For addresses inside the Hilton village limits, use the Hilton village office, not Parma.\n\nFee schedules are online (2023 version). Call to confirm current electrical permit amounts."

  example: {
    en: "A homeowner in Parma (outside Hilton village) wants to add a subpanel for a detached garage. They file an electrical permit with the Parma Building Department. They pick NYEIA as their inspection agency. After the work passes, NYEIA issues the Certificate of Compliance. Parma closes the permit."
