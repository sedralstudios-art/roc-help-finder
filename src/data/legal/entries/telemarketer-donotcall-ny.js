  title: { en: "Telemarketers and the Do Not Call Registry — How to Stop Unwanted Sales Calls" },

  summary: {
    en: "The federal Do Not Call Registry and New York's Do Not Call Law prohibit most telemarketing calls to registered numbers. Once a number is on the list, telemarketers have 31 days to stop calling. Calls that continue after that are violations — each one can result in fines up to $43,792 (federal) or $11,000 (state). The registry is free and permanent. Many people register but do not realize they can file complaints and that telemarketers can be fined for every illegal call."

      "Any person with a phone number — landline or cell phone — who receives unwanted telemarketing calls.",
      "Registration is free and does not expire.",
      "Some calls are exempt: charities, political calls, surveys, and calls from companies the person has an existing business relationship with.",
      "Scam calls and robocalls are illegal regardless of whether the number is on the registry."
    ]
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Under the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act (47 USC § 227) and NY General Business Law § 399-z, telemarketers cannot call numbers on the Do Not Call Registry. The registry is maintained by the FTC. Once registered, the number stays on the list permanently (previously it expired after 5 years — that changed in 2008). Telemarketers have 31 days to remove the number from their call lists. After that, every call to a registered number is a violation. Exempt calls: calls from or on behalf of charities, political organizations, and survey companies are not covered. Calls from companies the person has done business with in the last 18 months are also exempt — but the person can ask the company to stop, and it must comply. Robocalls (prerecorded telemarketing messages) require prior express written consent — regardless of the Do Not Call Registry. Calls that spoof caller ID (showing a fake number) are illegal under the Truth in Caller ID Act. For each violation, the FTC can fine the telemarketer up to $43,792. The NY AG can fine up to $11,000 per call."

      "For robocalls and scam calls, file a complaint with the FCC at fcc.gov/consumers/guides/stop-unwanted-robocalls-and-texts.",

  example: {
    en: "A man in Rochester registers his cell phone on the Do Not Call Registry. He continues to receive 3-4 telemarketing calls per week from the same company. He files a complaint at donotcall.gov each time, noting the date, time, and caller ID number. The FTC investigates the company. Each call after the 31-day window is a separate violation. The company faces fines of up to $43,792 per call."
