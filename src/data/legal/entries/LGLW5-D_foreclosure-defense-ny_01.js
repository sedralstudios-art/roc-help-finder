  summary: {
    en: "If you fall behind on mortgage payments, the lender may start foreclosure proceedings to take your home. New York has strong protections for homeowners, including mandatory settlement conferences, a 90-day pre-foreclosure notice, and the right to cure. The process is slow — often 1 to 3 years — which gives time to negotiate, modify the loan, or find other options. Free legal help is available."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Foreclosure in New York is a judicial process — the lender must sue in court to take the property. It cannot happen without a judge's order. Before filing, the lender must send a 90-day pre-foreclosure notice (RPAPL § 1304) that lists at least five HUD-approved housing counseling agencies. After filing, the court schedules mandatory settlement conferences where the homeowner and lender negotiate in front of a court attorney. The goal is to find an alternative to foreclosure: loan modification (changing the terms to lower payments), forbearance (temporary pause), repayment plan, short sale, or deed in lieu of foreclosure. During the process, the homeowner stays in the home. New York foreclosures are among the slowest in the country. Even after a judgment, the homeowner has a redemption period and the property must go through a referee sale. Answering the foreclosure complaint is critical — a default judgment speeds up the process and eliminates most defenses."

  example: {
    en: "After losing a job, a homeowner in Greece falls three months behind on the mortgage. The lender sends a 90-day pre-foreclosure notice. The homeowner calls PathStone, a HUD-approved counselor, and begins working on a loan modification application. When the lender files suit anyway, the homeowner contacts Legal Aid. A lawyer answers the complaint, attends the settlement conference, and negotiates a loan modification that reduces the monthly payment. The foreclosure case is discontinued."
