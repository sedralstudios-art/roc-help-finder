  whatItMeans: {
    en: "The NYS Office of Victim Services (OVS) runs a compensation program for victims of violent crimes. The program pays for expenses that are not covered by insurance, Medicaid, or other sources. Covered expenses include medical and dental bills, mental health counseling, lost wages and loss of support for dependents, funeral and burial costs, and the cost of crime scene cleanup. The crime must have been reported to police or another law enforcement agency. The claim must be filed within one year of the crime, though extensions are available for good cause — especially for child victims. The victim does not need to be a U.S. citizen. Undocumented victims can file claims. The victim does not need to cooperate with prosecution to be eligible, though cooperation may be considered. OVS is a payer of last resort — it covers what other sources do not. The maximum award varies by expense type but can cover significant costs."

  example: {
    en: "Marcus was stabbed during a robbery and spent three days in the hospital. His medical bills totaled $22,000. His health insurance covered most of it, but he had a $3,500 out-of-pocket cost and missed two weeks of work. Marcus filed a claim with OVS through a victim advocate at the DA's office. OVS covered his $3,500 medical costs and $1,800 in lost wages. The process took about three months."
