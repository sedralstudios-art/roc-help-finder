  whatItMeans: {
    en: "The New York Essential Plan was created under the Affordable Care Act's Basic Health Program option (42 USC 18051) and implemented through NY Insurance Law Section 3222 and the NY Health Benefit Exchange. It provides health insurance at very low or no cost to New Yorkers whose income is too high for Medicaid but not high enough to afford a private Qualified Health Plan (QHP) even with ACA subsidies. Eligibility: an adult 19 to 64 (not eligible for Medicare), lawfully present in the U.S., and household income between 138 and 250 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). In 2026 the upper end of the FPL bracket for Essential Plan is approximately 39,125 dollars for a single adult and 80,375 dollars for a family of four. The 2024 NY budget expanded the upper income limit from 200 to 250 percent, making the Essential Plan available to significantly more working New Yorkers. IMPORTANT: CMS approved NY's request to terminate the 1332 waiver effective July 1, 2026, which reverts the upper eligibility limit back from 250 to 200 percent of FPL. Enrollees in the 200 to 250 percent bracket will lose Essential Plan eligibility on that date and need to transition to a Qualified Health Plan with tax credit subsidies through NY State of Health. Costs are dramatically lower than private insurance. Monthly premium is 0 dollars for enrollees under 200 percent of FPL. Enrollees at 200 to 250 percent pay a small premium (typically 15 to 30 dollars per month). No deductible applies. Copays are minimal — typically 0 to 25 dollars for doctor visits and prescriptions. All essential health benefits under the ACA are covered: preventive care, primary care, specialists, hospital care, mental health, maternity, prescription drugs, and more. Pre-existing conditions cannot be excluded. No waiting period for coverage of existing conditions. Enrollment is through the NY State of Health marketplace at nystateofhealth.ny.gov or by phone at 1-855-355-5777. Like Medicaid, Essential Plan enrollment is year-round — there is no open enrollment window. A person whose income fits Essential Plan can apply any time. A person whose Medicaid eligibility ends because of income increase is typically auto-transferred to Essential Plan without interruption in coverage. Plans are administered by private insurers including Fidelis Care, MVP, Excellus BlueCross BlueShield, Healthfirst, and others in the Monroe County region. The enrollee picks the plan from available options. Provider networks differ so an enrollee should confirm that their preferred doctors participate. Essential Plan enrollees get the same benefits as the chosen insurer's commercial plan customers, but at the subsidized cost. The 2024 expansion also added vision and dental as included benefits for new enrollees, further aligning with Medicaid coverage. Historically Essential Plan had limited vision and dental — the 2024 update closed that gap. An enrollee whose income changes must report within 30 days. If income drops below 138 percent, the person becomes Medicaid-eligible and is auto-moved to Medicaid. If income rises above 250 percent, the person is transitioned to a Qualified Health Plan with tax credit subsidies. Immigration status rules: lawful permanent residents (green card holders) qualify regardless of length of residence (no 5-year bar that applies to Medicaid). DACA recipients became eligible for Essential Plan in 2024 following a federal policy change. Undocumented immigrants do not qualify for Essential Plan, but may qualify for Emergency Medicaid (coverage of emergency services under PHL 366) or for low-cost hospital care through PHL 2807-k financial assistance. The Essential Plan has been studied by Manatt and other health policy researchers as one of the most generous public insurance programs in the U.S., providing full benefits at near-zero cost. NY is one of only 2 states (with Minnesota) that implemented a Basic Health Program under ACA Section 1331."

    en: "Dmitri is 34, works part-time as a barista in Rochester, and earns 26,000 dollars a year — about 166 percent of the federal poverty level for a single person. Too high for Medicaid, and a Qualified Health Plan with ACA tax credit still had a 150 dollar monthly premium plus 2,500 dollar deductible. He enrolled in the Essential Plan through NY State of Health with zero monthly premium. His coverage started the first of the following month. He picked Fidelis Care which included his primary care doctor at Strong Memorial. All benefits including mental health counseling cost 0 to 25 dollars per visit."
