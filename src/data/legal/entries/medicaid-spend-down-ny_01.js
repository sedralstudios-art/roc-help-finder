  summary: {
    en: "If your income is a little above the Medicaid limit, you can still get Medicaid through a program called spend-down. It works kind of like a deductible. Once your medical bills add up to your extra income, Medicaid pays for the rest of the month."

      "Adults 65 and older whose income is above the Medicaid limit.",
      "People who Social Security or the state says are disabled.",
      "People who are legally blind.",
      "You also have to meet the Medicaid savings limit and other rules.",
      "This program uses the Non-MAGI rules. (Non-MAGI is a set of Medicaid rules mostly for seniors and disabled people. It's different from the rules for other adults under 65.)"

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "The Medicaid Excess Income Program has a few names: spend-down, surplus income, or Medicaid deductible. It all means the same thing.\n\nHere's how it works: the difference between your monthly income and the Medicaid income level is your \"extra income.\" If your medical bills that month add up to your extra income, Medicaid covers the rest of the month. The bills can be paid or unpaid.\n\nWhat bills count? Doctor visits, prescriptions, medical supplies, insurance premiums. Over-the-counter medicine your doctor recommended. Rides to medical appointments. Bills from your spouse or kids under 21 can count too.\n\nYou don't have to do the math yourself. Your local DSS figures out your extra income amount and sends you a notice.\n\nThe Medicaid income and savings limits are updated every January. Current limits are at health.ny.gov."

  example: {
    en: "Rose is 72. She lives alone on $2,100 a month. The Medicaid income limit for a single person is lower than that. Her extra income is about $280 a month. Each month she sends her prescription receipts and doctor visit bills to her county DSS. Because her medical bills are more than $280, Medicaid covers her for the rest of that month. Her home aide visits and the rest of her prescriptions are covered."
