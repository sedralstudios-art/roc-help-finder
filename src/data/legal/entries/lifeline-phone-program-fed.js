  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Lifeline is a federal program created under the Telecommunications Act at 47 USC § 254, which requires universal-service support to keep telephone and broadband service available to low-income households. The Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) administers the program under FCC oversight. The standard benefit pays up to $9.25 per month off the cost of a phone plan, an internet plan, or a bundled phone-and-internet plan. The Enhanced Tribal benefit pays up to $34.25 per month for households on qualifying Tribal lands. Many participating providers offer plans at or below the benefit amount, so the Lifeline discount often covers the full monthly bill — the household pays nothing out of pocket. Eligibility has two pathways. Income-based eligibility requires household income at or below 135% of the federal poverty guideline. Program-based eligibility requires participation in one of the qualifying programs — SNAP, Medicaid, SSI, Federal Public Housing Assistance (Section 8 or public housing), or Veterans Pension and Survivors Benefit. Program-based eligibility typically does not need separate income proof — the USAC National Verifier checks the applicable program database and often approves in minutes. Income-based eligibility requires documentation — a tax return, three consecutive pay stubs, or a benefits letter. The National Verifier runs the eligibility check for most states. Applicants go to lifelinesupport.org, create an account, and submit the application with supporting documents if needed. After approval, the applicant has 90 days to choose a participating provider and sign up for service. Each state has a list of participating providers; the National Verifier shows the available options by ZIP code. Oregon and Texas operate their own state portals rather than using the National Verifier. The Safe Connections Act adds protections for survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking — emergency Lifeline support is available for up to six months with additional privacy safeguards during the application process. Survivors can also separate a shared phone line from an abuser's account without penalty. Recertification is required every year. USAC often recertifies automatically through database matching. When automatic recertification fails, the subscriber receives a notice and must respond within the stated window to keep the benefit. A Lifeline subscriber on a plan with no monthly charge must use the service at least once every 30 days (a call, text, or data session) to keep the account active. Lifeline does not affect SNAP, Medicaid, or other public-benefit eligibility. The earlier Affordable Connectivity Program, which provided a larger broadband discount, ended in 2024 — Lifeline is a separate, ongoing program. Applications and recertifications are always free. No legitimate provider or government agency charges a fee to apply for Lifeline. Fraud or aggressive marketing that charges for application help can be reported to the FCC Lifeline Fraud Tip Line."

  example: {
    en: "Rita lives alone in Monroe County and receives SNAP benefits. She had no phone and was missing calls from her doctor and caseworker. She went to lifelinesupport.org and applied for Lifeline. The National Verifier checked the SNAP database and approved her within minutes — no separate income documentation required. The system showed five participating wireless providers in her ZIP code with $0-a-month plans. Rita chose one and completed enrollment. A phone arrived in the mail within a week. She now has a working phone at no monthly cost. Under the auto-recertification rule, USAC will recheck her SNAP status each year; if it changes, she will receive notice before any benefit termination."
