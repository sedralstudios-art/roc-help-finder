  summary: {
    en: "SSDI stands for Social Security Disability Insurance. It pays monthly checks to people who can't work because of a disability. It's based on your past work and the Social Security taxes you already paid. There is no income or savings limit to qualify."

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Adults 18 to 64 with a disability that keeps them from working full time.",
      "The disability has to be expected to last at least 12 months, or to end in death.",
      "You must have earned enough Social Security work credits from past jobs. How many you need depends on your age when the disability started.",
      "Younger workers who become disabled need fewer credits.",
      "Some family members — a spouse, former spouse, or kids — may also get checks based on a disabled worker's record.",
      "There is no income or savings test. SSDI looks only at your work history and medical condition."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "SSDI is a federal program run by the Social Security Administration (SSA). It pays monthly money to people who can't work anymore because of a disability. How much you get depends on what you earned over the years you worked. Everyone's check is different. You can see your estimate at ssa.gov.\n\nAfter you are approved, you wait 5 months before payments start. After 24 months on SSDI, you get Medicare.\n\nSSDI is different from SSI. SSI is for people with little or no work history, and it's based on how much money you have now. You can get both SSDI and SSI at the same time if your SSDI check is small."

  example: {
    en: "Angela worked as a home health aide for 15 years. A back injury made it impossible to keep working. She applied for SSDI online. Her first application was denied. She appealed and asked for a hearing with a judge. A disability lawyer helped her get more medical records and prepare. The judge approved her claim. After the 5-month wait, her monthly SSDI check started. Two years later, she got Medicare."
