  whatItMeans: {
    en: "New York Vehicle and Traffic Law Section 311 combined with the Comprehensive Motor Vehicle Insurance Reparations Act (Insurance Law Article 51) sets three required coverage categories for every registered New York vehicle. Bodily injury liability of at least 25,000 dollars per person and 50,000 dollars per accident covers the injured party when the insured driver is at fault. Property damage liability of 10,000 dollars covers repair or replacement of the other driver's vehicle or damaged property. No-fault personal injury protection (PIP) of 50,000 dollars covers medical expenses, up to 2,000 dollars a month in lost wages, and 25 dollars a day for household help for the insured driver, passengers, and any pedestrians hit by the insured vehicle — regardless of who caused the crash. Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage (SUM) must match the liability limits and pays the insured driver when the other driver has no insurance or not enough. These minimums are very low compared with real medical and repair costs. A serious injury can easily exceed 100,000 dollars in medical bills alone, which is why insurance agents usually recommend optional coverage of 250,000/500,000 dollars on bodily injury, 100,000 dollars on property damage, and an umbrella policy for owners with assets to protect. Driving an uninsured vehicle on a New York road is a violation of Vehicle and Traffic Law § 319 and carries fines from 150 to 1,500 dollars depending on circumstances, up to 15 days in jail, and mandatory suspension of registration for the time the vehicle was uninsured plus the length of the gap. A registration lapse over 90 days triggers an automatic DMV suspension under Vehicle and Traffic Law § 318. Reinstatement requires paying a civil penalty of 8 dollars per day for each day uninsured, up to 900 dollars, plus a 50 dollar termination fee. Car insurance also satisfies the New York financial security law, which Monroe County DMV checks when renewing registration. A driver who moves to NY from another state has 30 days to register the vehicle in NY and switch to a NY-compliant policy. A teen driver on a parent policy is covered at the parent policy limits. Rideshare drivers (Uber, Lyft) are covered by the rideshare company's policy while logged in, but still need a personal NY policy that the rideshare policy supplements."

  example: {
    en: "Karim was rear-ended on Monroe Avenue by a driver whose policy had lapsed the week before. Karim's own NY policy included uninsured motorist (SUM) coverage at 50,000 dollars. He filed a no-fault PIP claim with his own carrier for his medical bills and a SUM claim for the portion of his injuries above PIP. Because his own policy matched the statutory minimum, he recovered 47,000 dollars for the injury. The at-fault driver was cited under Vehicle and Traffic Law § 319 for uninsured operation, fined 750 dollars, and had registration suspended for 91 days."
