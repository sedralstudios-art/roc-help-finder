  summary: {
    en: "If you have very little or no income and need food right away, you may qualify for expedited SNAP benefits. The law requires that these benefits be issued within 7 days of your application."
  },

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Households with gross monthly income below $150 and liquid resources (cash, checking, savings) below $100.",
      "Households whose monthly rent or mortgage plus utilities exceed their combined monthly income and liquid resources.",
      "Migrant or seasonal farmworker households that are destitute.",
      "Households experiencing homelessness."
    ]
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Expedited SNAP is a faster version of the regular SNAP process. It exists so that people in crisis can get food help without waiting the standard 30 days. Under federal law, the local Department of Social Services must issue expedited benefits within 7 calendar days of the application date. In some cases, benefits may be available within 24 to 48 hours. Expedited benefits are a one-time emergency issuance. The full application process must still be completed afterward. This means an interview and documents will still be required. If those steps are not completed, ongoing monthly benefits will not continue. The DSS office must screen every applicant for expedited eligibility on the same day the application is filed. This screening happens even if the full interview cannot take place that day."
  },

  yourRights: {
    en: [
      "You have the right to be screened for expedited SNAP on the same day you apply.",
      "You have the right to receive expedited benefits within 7 calendar days if you qualify.",
      "You have the right to apply even if you do not have all of your documents with you.",
      "You have the right to appoint an authorized representative to apply on your behalf if you cannot travel to the DSS office.",
      "You have the right to a fair hearing if you believe you qualified for expedited benefits and did not receive them on time.",
      "You have the right to request a referral to a food pantry while waiting for your benefits to be processed."

  example: {
    en: "James lost his job in Genesee County and had $40 left in his bank account. His rent was due in a week. He went to his county DSS office first thing in the morning and filled out a SNAP application. The office screened him for expedited benefits the same day. Because his income and savings were well below the threshold, he received his EBT card with emergency benefits within three days. He still had to go back for a full interview and bring his documents, but the expedited benefit kept him fed while he completed the process."
