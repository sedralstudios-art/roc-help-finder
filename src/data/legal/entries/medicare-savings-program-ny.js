  title: { en: "NY Medicare Savings Programs — QMB and QI Help Paying Medicare Premiums and Cost-Sharing" },

  summary: {
    en: "Medicare Savings Programs, or MSPs, are state Medicaid programs that pay some or all Medicare costs for low-income Medicare beneficiaries. Federal authority is 42 USC § 1396a(a)(10)(E). NY runs two tiers — QMB (Qualified Medicare Beneficiary) covers premiums plus all deductibles, copays, and coinsurance; QI (Qualifying Individual) covers only the Part B premium. NY has no asset test for either program — income is the only measure. Enrollment in QMB or QI automatically enrolls the beneficiary in the federal Extra Help prescription program."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Medicare Savings Programs are state Medicaid programs that pay some or all of the Medicare out-of-pocket costs for low-income beneficiaries. The federal authority is 42 USC § 1396a(a)(10)(E), which requires state Medicaid programs to pay specified Medicare costs for QMBs and to offer limited premium-only help to QIs. NY implements MSP through the Department of Health and the local social services districts. NY runs two MSP tiers after the 2023 expansion consolidated the old SLMB middle tier into QMB. QMB (Qualified Medicare Beneficiary) is the full-coverage tier. A QMB enrollee has the following Medicare costs paid by Medicaid: Medicare Part A premium (for beneficiaries who owe one — most do not), Medicare Part B premium, and all Medicare deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. A QMB enrollee should never be billed by a Medicare provider for any Medicare-covered service beyond what Medicaid has paid. Federal law bars balance billing of QMB beneficiaries. If a provider bills a QMB patient anyway, the bill is improper and can be challenged through 1-800-MEDICARE or the Medicare Beneficiary Ombudsman. QI (Qualifying Individual) is the premium-only tier. A QI enrollee has the Medicare Part B premium paid. QI does not pay deductibles, copays, or coinsurance. The 2026 Medicare Part B premium is about $202.90 per month, so QI saves the enrollee over $2,400 per year. NY removed the MSP asset test in 2023. No look at bank accounts, home equity, vehicles, or other property is allowed. Eligibility turns on income alone, with certain deductions applied per federal SSI rules. Extra Help (Low-Income Subsidy, or LIS) is a separate federal program that pays most Part D prescription drug costs. Enrollment in QMB or QI automatically enrolls the beneficiary in Extra Help. With Extra Help, Part D copays drop to a few dollars per prescription and the Part D monthly premium is often $0. A key change since 2024: Extra Help income limits rose to 150% of federal poverty level, higher than the QI MSP ceiling of 186%. Wait — the opposite is true: QI goes up to 186% so QI enrollees always qualify for Extra Help, but beneficiaries above 186% (too high for QI) might still qualify for Extra Help alone if their income is below 150%. Extra Help is applied for through the Social Security Administration at ssa.gov/medicare/prescriptionhelp or by phone at [number being verified]. MSP applications go through the local social services district. Monroe County residents apply at Monroe County DHS. NY State of Health also accepts MSP applications for some applicants. Processing takes 45 days in routine cases. A denial or incorrect determination can be appealed through the NY fair hearing process under SSL § 22 within 60 days. Practical note on improper QMB billing: showing the provider's office staff the Medicare card and the Medicaid or MSP notice usually resolves an improper bill. Persistent billing violations can be reported to the NY Attorney General's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit."

  example: {
    en: "Gloria is a 71-year-old Monroe County resident living alone on Social Security retirement of about $1,500 per month. She has Medicare Parts A and B. The Part B premium, copays, and prescription costs strained her fixed income. She applied for QMB at Monroe County DHS. Because NY applies no asset test (removed in 2023) and her income was below the QMB threshold, she was approved. Medicaid now pays her Part B premium directly to CMS. Her doctor visits and hospital copays are covered under QMB at no out-of-pocket cost. QMB enrollment automatically enrolled her in Extra Help, reducing her Part D prescription copays to a few dollars each. If a provider bills her for a Medicare copay, she shows the office her Medicaid and Medicare cards to resolve the improper bill."
