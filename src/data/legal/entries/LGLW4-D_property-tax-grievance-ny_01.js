  summary: {
    en: "If you think your home's assessed value is too high, you can file a grievance. You have to do it on Grievance Day — the 4th Tuesday of May in most New York towns. You don't need a lawyer. A successful grievance can save you hundreds or thousands of dollars in property taxes each year."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Every town in New York sets an assessed value on your property each year. Your property tax bill is based on that assessment. If the assessment is too high, your taxes are too high.\n\nYou can challenge the assessment through a process called \"grievance.\" This is set up by Real Property Tax Law (RPTL) Article 5.\n\nGrievance Day is the 4th Tuesday of May in most towns. Some towns have a different day — check with your town assessor. (NYC and Nassau County have different deadlines.) You have to file on or before Grievance Day.\n\nYou file Form RP-524 (Complaint on Real Property Assessment) with the town assessor. You can hand it in, mail it, or drop it off.\n\nThe Board of Assessment Review (BAR) hears your case. It's a local group — not a judge in a courtroom. You go in, show your evidence, and they decide.\n\nIf they deny you, you have more options. For a home (residential), you can file a Small Claims Assessment Review (SCAR). That's a low-cost appeal handled by a hearing officer. SCAR filing deadline is 30 days after the final assessment roll is filed — usually late July. Filing fee is $30.\n\nFor commercial property, the appeal route is an Article 7 lawsuit in state Supreme Court.\n\nWhat counts as grounds for grievance:\n1. Excessive assessment — your property is assessed at more than its actual market value.\n2. Unequal assessment — your property is assessed at a higher percentage than similar properties.\n3. Misclassification — your property type is wrong (residential vs commercial, etc.).\n4. Unlawful assessment — the assessment is illegal for some reason.\n5. Wrongly denied exemption — you should have STAR, Senior, Veteran, or Disability exemption but didn't get it."

  example: {
    en: "Mark owns a home in Webster. His assessment is $280,000. He looks at recent sales of similar homes on his street and finds they sold for $240,000 to $255,000. On May 22 (the 4th Tuesday of May), he files Form RP-524 at the Webster assessor's office. He includes printouts from the real estate listing service. The Board of Assessment Review meets in June, listens to Mark, and reduces his assessment to $250,000. His property tax bill goes down by several hundred dollars that year. If the BAR had denied him, he could have filed SCAR for $30 (check the County Clerk for current fees) by late July."
