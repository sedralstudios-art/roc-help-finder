  summary: {
    en: "When a New York vehicle owner dies, the car can be transferred without going through full probate in most cases. A surviving spouse can use DMV Form MV-349.1 if the vehicle is worth 25,000 dollars or less. A non-spouse heir usually needs a certificate from Surrogate's Court or a small estate affidavit before the DMV will transfer the title. The steps are free or low-cost and can usually be done in one DMV visit."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "New York Vehicle and Traffic Law Section 2113 allows a surviving spouse to transfer title of a vehicle without going through Surrogate's Court if the vehicle is worth 25,000 dollars or less. The spouse files DMV Form MV-349.1 (Spouse's Affidavit) along with the original title, a certified copy of the death certificate, a completed title transfer form, and proof of insurance in the surviving spouse's name. The transaction is usually processed at the DMV in one visit and costs only the regular title transfer fee. If the vehicle is worth more than 25,000 dollars or the person inheriting is not the surviving spouse, a different process applies. For an estate under 50,000 dollars in total value, the heir can file a Voluntary Administration (small estate affidavit) at Monroe County Surrogate's Court on Form SCPA 1301 — this is a simplified probate that costs under 45 dollars and does not require a lawyer. The Surrogate's Court issues a certificate of Voluntary Administrator that the DMV accepts as authority to transfer the title. For a larger estate, the named executor must be appointed by Surrogate's Court through a full probate proceeding, and the Letters Testamentary from the court authorize the executor to transfer title. A joint-titled vehicle (two names on the title with an or between them) passes automatically to the surviving owner — only the death certificate is needed to remove the deceased name. A vehicle with a lien must first have the lien released by the lender before title can transfer. The deceased registration is still valid for 30 days from the date of death, and the surviving family can drive the vehicle during that period while the transfer is arranged. Sales tax is not charged on a transfer between spouses or by inheritance from an estate."

  example: {
    en: "After Roberto died, his widow Elena needed to transfer their 2018 Honda into her name. The car had been titled only in Roberto's name. Elena brought the original title, Roberto's death certificate, a completed Form MV-349.1, and her driver license to the Monroe County DMV on West Main Street. Because the Honda was worth about 14,000 dollars (well under the 25,000 dollar cap), the DMV accepted the spouse's affidavit and issued a new title in Elena's name that same day. The only fee was the standard title transfer fee. No court filing was needed."
