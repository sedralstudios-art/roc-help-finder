  summary: {
    en: "Rush is a small rural town. Ordinary like-kind plumbing repairs (fixing a leak, replacing a faucet) don't need a permit. Structural changes and work covered by the state Plumbing Code need a permit. Call the Building Inspector to confirm fees and homeowner rules before starting."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Rush publishes a permit-trigger list that's based on project scope, not licensee type. Ordinary like-kind replacement (faucet swap, clog clearing, leak repair at an existing fitting) is exempt from permits.\n\nBut structural changes — new fixture installation, water heater replacement, sewer line work — are covered by the state Plumbing Code and typically need a permit. The exact list of what needs a permit isn't spelled out on the public page; call to confirm.\n\nRush doesn't have its own plumber licensing chapter. Plumbers need liability insurance and workers comp. Whether Rush honors a Rochester Examining Board plumber certificate and whether homeowners can pull plumbing permits aren't published. Call (585) 533-1312 to confirm.\n\nThe Town Clerk accepts permit applications outside inspector hours (Mon-Thu 7am-12pm)."
  },

  example: {
    en: "A Rush homeowner's toilet flush valve breaks. Fixing it is a like-kind repair — no permit needed. A few months later, they want to add a laundry room with new plumbing. That's a structural addition and needs a permit. They call Building Inspector, apply, and get inspected after install."
