  summary: {
    en: "When a car is repossessed in New York, the lender must follow specific rules. The repo agent cannot breach the peace — no threats, no force, no entering a locked garage. After repossession, the borrower has the right to retrieve personal belongings from the vehicle. The lender must send a written notice before selling the car, and the borrower has the right to redeem the vehicle by paying the full amount owed."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Under New York UCC Article 9 (Sections 9-609 and 9-610) and the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rules, a lender can repossess a vehicle without going to court if the borrower is in default — but the repossession must be done without breaching the peace. Breach of peace includes physical force or threats, breaking into a locked garage, taking the car over the borrower's verbal objection if the borrower is present, and creating a confrontation. If a breach of peace occurs, the repossession is wrongful and the lender can be liable for damages. After repossession, the lender must send a written notice to the borrower stating how to redeem the vehicle (pay the full balance owed plus repo costs), the date and method of the planned sale (public auction or private sale), and the borrower's right to an accounting of the amount owed. Personal property left in the vehicle belongs to the borrower — not the lender. The borrower has the right to retrieve all personal belongings. If the lender sells or disposes of personal property (tools, child car seats, medications, work equipment, documents), the lender is liable for the value. After the car is sold, if the sale price is less than the amount owed, the lender can seek a deficiency judgment against the borrower for the difference. If the sale price exceeds the amount owed, the surplus must be returned to the borrower. Self-help repossession is the standard in NY because court-ordered repossession is rarely worth the time and expense for the lender. Some states require the lender to go to court before taking the vehicle; NY is not one of them. The trade-off is the breach-of-peace rule, which gives the borrower a meaningful tool: any objection during the repo can stop it. Once the agent retreats and returns later when no one is present, however, the second attempt is generally lawful. Buying the car back at the lender's auction is a separate strategy. Lenders are required to sell repossessed vehicles in a commercially reasonable manner, and many sales are open auctions where the borrower or a friend can bid. Buying back at auction is sometimes cheaper than redeeming the loan, and it ends the deficiency exposure if the bid covers what is owed plus the repo costs."

  example: {
    en: "After missing two car payments, Maria's car was repossessed from her driveway in Henrietta overnight. Her work tools ($800 worth), her child's car seat, and her medications were inside. She called the repo company the next morning and arranged to retrieve her belongings. The company initially said she had to pay $150 to access the vehicle. Maria told them New York law requires them to return personal property without charge. The company allowed her to collect everything at no cost. Maria then received the required written notice about the planned sale and had 15 days to redeem the vehicle by paying the full balance."
