  summary: {
    en: "A benefits verification letter is an official document from the agency administering a benefit that confirms a person is receiving that benefit — and usually the amount. Many third parties (landlords, courts, schools, utility assistance programs, phone discount programs, other benefit applications) require one. For NY state benefits (SNAP, Temporary Assistance, Medicaid) the myBenefits portal at mybenefits.ny.gov is the fastest path. For Social Security benefits (SSI, SSDI, retirement, Medicare) the SSA my Social Security account generates a letter instantly."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "A benefits verification letter is the document third parties accept as official proof a person receives a benefit. The letter typically shows the program name, the benefit amount, the coverage dates, and whoever is on the case. Verification is issued by the agency that pays the benefit, not by the third party asking for it. For NY Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance (OTDA) programs — SNAP, Temporary Assistance, and Safety Net Assistance — the myBenefits portal at mybenefits.ny.gov is the standard source. A recipient who created an NY.gov account can sign in, view case details, and download the most recent approval or budget notice. The portal also lets recipients submit verification documents for the case, report changes, and recertify benefits. NY language assistance is available on the portal in 13 languages including Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Russian, Haitian Creole, Korean, Italian, Bengali, Yiddish, Polish, French, and Urdu. For Medicaid, there are two tracks. MAGI Medicaid (the Modified Adjusted Gross Income pathway, covering most adults under 65 and children) is administered through NY State of Health at nystateofhealth.ny.gov — recipients log in there for case documents. Non-MAGI Medicaid (covering seniors and the disabled) runs through the local social services district, so Monroe County Department of Human Services issues those letters. For Social Security benefits (SSI, SSDI, retirement, Medicare), the Social Security Administration provides an instant benefit verification letter through my Social Security at ssa.gov/manage-benefits/get-benefit-letter. The letter shows benefit type, monthly amount, and Medicare coverage status. It is often referred to as a 'proof of income letter.' The SSA automated phone line at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778) is available 24 hours a day — the prompt to request proof of income is spoken as 'proof of income' after the greeting. For the NY State Supplement Program (SSP) — the state top-up for SSI recipients — verification is requested through the mySSP portal at otda.ny.gov/programs/ssp or by calling 1-855-488-0541. Letters are mailed to the address on file. Walk-in and phone verification from the local DSS is the fallback when online access is not available. Monroe County Department of Human Services at 111 Westfall Road, Rochester can provide printed verification during business hours, often same-day. An approval notice, EBT card, or Medicaid card is sometimes accepted as informal proof, but most programs require the dated official letter. For mobile document workflow the NYDocSubmit app (Apple App Store and Google Play) lets recipients photograph and upload verification documents directly to the local district; the app also lets the district return letters electronically in some jurisdictions. When a third party flatly rejects the portal-downloaded document, the recipient can request an original letter on agency letterhead — OTDA programs via the local DSS, Social Security via SSA, and NY State of Health via the NYSOH customer service line at (855) 355-5777. Legal Aid Society of Rochester and LawNY can help a recipient whose verification is blocked or whose case is wrongly closed."

  example: {
    en: "Amara is a Rochester parent receiving SNAP. Her child care subsidy provider asked for written proof of current SNAP enrollment. She signed into mybenefits.ny.gov, downloaded the most recent approval notice showing the active case, and printed a copy. The subsidy office accepted it. Later, when her landlord asked for proof of income for a lease renewal, Amara used ssa.gov/manage-benefits/get-benefit-letter to generate an SSDI verification letter in under a minute. Both documents were free and came from the agency that issues the benefit, which is what the landlord and subsidy office required."
