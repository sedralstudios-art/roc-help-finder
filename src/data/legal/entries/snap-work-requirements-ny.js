  summary: {
    en: "Most SNAP recipients have general work-registration rules, but a specific group — Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs) ages 18-54 — faces a stricter three-month time limit unless they work or participate in a work program for 20 hours per week. Exemptions and waivers apply. Many participants qualify for exemptions they do not know about."
  },

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Any SNAP recipient age 16-59 subject to general work registration (most adults).",
      "Any SNAP recipient age 18-54 considered an ABAWD (able-bodied adult without dependents) subject to the three-month limit.",
      "Any SNAP recipient required to participate in SNAP Employment and Training (SNAP E&T).",
      "Any SNAP recipient facing sanctions, reduction, or termination for missing a work requirement."
    ]
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "The Food and Nutrition Act (7 USC Section 2015) and 7 CFR Part 273 set SNAP work requirements. There are two main layers. General work registration: most SNAP recipients ages 16-59 must register for work, accept a suitable job if offered, and not voluntarily quit a job of 30+ hours per week without good cause. Exemptions include being physically or mentally unfit, caring for a child under 6 or an incapacitated person, being pregnant, being enrolled at least half-time in school, or already working 30+ hours. ABAWD time limit: ABAWDs ages 18-54 (raised from 49 by the 2023 budget deal, with phased implementation) can only receive SNAP for three months in a 36-month period unless they work, participate in a qualifying work program, or volunteer for 20 hours per week (about 80 hours per month). Exemptions beyond the general ones include homelessness (added 2023), being a veteran, or being a former foster youth ages 18-24 (added 2023). States can request waivers for areas with high unemployment — New York has historically qualified for waivers in many counties. Monroe County's waiver status shifts with economic conditions — check current status with DSS. When a waiver is active, ABAWDs in the waived area do not face the three-month limit. SNAP Employment and Training (SNAP E&T) offers education, job training, and job placement to SNAP recipients — participation can satisfy the work requirement, and E&T activities are often covered with transportation and child care support. Participation is voluntary in most cases but can be mandatory for ABAWDs losing benefits. Good cause for missing a work requirement includes illness, transportation failure, a court appearance, a family emergency, and similar unavoidable situations."

  example: {
    en: "A 32-year-old Rochester resident with no children was receiving SNAP while between jobs. After three months, DSS notified him he had exhausted his ABAWD time limit and would be terminated unless he worked or volunteered 80 hours per month. He had been dealing with a medical condition that made consistent work difficult. He provided a doctor's note to his case manager documenting the limitation. DSS approved a medical exemption, classified him as unfit for work, and SNAP continued without the time limit. He also enrolled in SNAP E&T where he received training and job-search support tailored to his limitations."
