  summary: {
    en: "Theft of a delivered package from a porch or doorstep is larceny in New York. Under $1,000 in value, it is petit larceny (Penal Law 155.25), a Class A misdemeanor. Over $1,000, it can be grand larceny (Penal Law 155.30 et seq.), a felony. Stealing mail from a USPS mailbox is also a federal crime under 18 USC 1708. Victims can file a police report and may be able to get a refund or replacement from the seller or delivery company."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Stealing a delivered package is prosecuted under New York's general larceny statutes. Under Penal Law Section 155.25, taking property worth $1,000 or less without permission is petit larceny — a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail. If the package contents are worth more than $1,000, the charge can be elevated to grand larceny under Penal Law Section 155.30 (Grand Larceny 4th Degree, a Class E felony) or higher tiers for greater values. NY legislators have repeatedly proposed a porch-piracy-specific statute that would make package theft a felony regardless of value; the most recent versions remained pending in the legislature. Stealing mail from a U.S. mailbox is also a separate federal crime under 18 U.S.C. Section 1708, carrying up to five years in prison. When a package is stolen, the delivery company's tracking usually shows it was delivered. Most sellers and delivery services have a process for filing a claim. Amazon, UPS, FedEx, and USPS each have their own claims procedures. Filing a police report helps with both the claim and any future prosecution."

  example: {
    en: "Mariana ordered prescription medication through a mail-order pharmacy. The tracking said it was delivered, but the package was gone when she got home. Her doorbell camera showed someone taking it off the porch 20 minutes after delivery. She filed a police report and shared the video. She also called the pharmacy, which sent a replacement. Mariana started having packages delivered to a locker at the nearby UPS store to prevent it from happening again."
