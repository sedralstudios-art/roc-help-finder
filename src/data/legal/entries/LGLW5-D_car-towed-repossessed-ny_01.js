  summary: {
    en: "If your car was towed by the city or a private company, or repossessed by a lender, you have rights. New York law limits towing fees, requires notice before sale, and gives you the right to get your belongings out of the car. For repossession, the lender must follow specific rules and you may have the right to get the car back."

      "Anyone whose vehicle was towed from a public street for parking violations, expired registration, or other traffic reasons.",
      "Anyone whose vehicle was towed by a private company from a parking lot, private property, or tow-away zone.",
      "Anyone whose vehicle was repossessed by a lender or finance company for missed loan payments."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "City/police tow: in Rochester, vehicles can be towed for unpaid parking tickets, expired registration, blocking a hydrant, or being in a tow-away zone. The car goes to the city impound lot. The owner must pay the outstanding tickets plus the tow fee plus daily storage to get it back. If not claimed within a set period, the city can sell the vehicle at auction. The owner has the right to a hearing to contest the tickets before paying. Private tow: a private property owner can authorize towing from their lot, but the tow company must follow VTL § 182 requirements — including posting signs, charging only authorized rates, and releasing personal belongings from the car without charge. Repossession: if a car loan is in default, the lender can repossess the vehicle without going to court (self-help repossession). However, the repossession cannot involve a breach of the peace — meaning the repo agent cannot use force, threats, or break into a locked garage. After repossession, the lender must send a notice before selling the vehicle, and the borrower has the right to 'redeem' (pay off the full loan balance) before the sale. Under UCC Article 9, the sale must be 'commercially reasonable.' If there is a deficiency (the sale price is less than what is owed), the lender can sue for the difference."

  example: {
    en: "A woman in Rochester comes outside and her car is gone. She calls the police non-emergency line and learns it was towed by the city for unpaid parking tickets. She goes to the impound lot and is told the total is $350 for tickets, tow, and storage. She requests a hearing on two tickets she believes were issued in error. The hearing officer dismisses one ticket, reducing her total. She pays the remainder and gets her car back."
