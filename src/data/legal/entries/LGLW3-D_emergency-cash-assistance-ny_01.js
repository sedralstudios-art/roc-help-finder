  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Emergency help is a one-time grant. It is not regular monthly benefits. It covers things like:\n\n1) Rent you owe, to stop an eviction.\n2) Heat, gas, or power about to be shut off.\n3) Being homeless or about to be homeless.\n4) Other crises that threaten your health or safety.\n\nThe amount depends on your situation. The money usually goes straight to your landlord, utility company, or vendor — not to you. For families with kids, the grant is usually free money you don't pay back. For single adults and couples without kids, help with rent or utility bills may be a no-interest loan. You sign a repayment paper when you are approved. Rent loans usually have to be paid back in 12 months. Utility loans usually have to be paid back in 24 months.\n\nWhen you apply, your local DSS office has to interview you and decide the same day."

  example: {
    en: "Carla is a single mother with one child. She fell behind on rent after missing two weeks of work from an illness. Her landlord gave her a notice to pay or leave. Carla went to Monroe County DSS and applied for emergency help. Because she has a child, she was checked for EAF. Her income was under 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. DSS called her landlord and paid the back rent directly. Carla got to stay, and she didn't have to pay the money back."
