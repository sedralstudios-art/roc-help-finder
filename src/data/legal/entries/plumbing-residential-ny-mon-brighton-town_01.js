  summary: {
    en: "Brighton requires a plumber to register with the town before pulling a plumbing permit. If you already have a City of Rochester plumber certificate, Brighton will honor it. Homeowners can do their own plumbing in their own single-family home, but they still need a permit. Fees are $5.50 per fixture."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "A plumbing permit is required for any new plumbing or changes to existing plumbing in Brighton. That includes kitchen and bath remodels with new fixtures, water heater installs, moving fixtures, and layout changes. Either a Brighton-registered plumber OR the owner of a single-family home (doing their own work) can pull the permit. Registered plumbers have to file an insurance certificate with the town. Homeowners doing work on their own home do NOT need to file insurance, but the work still has to meet the state building code. Brighton also automatically honors a Rochester Examining Board of Plumbers certificate — if you hold that, you can get a Brighton license."
  },

  example: {
    en: "A homeowner in Brighton wants to replace their water heater. They go to the Town Building and Planning Department, fill out a plumbing permit application, and pay $5.50 per fixture plus a $45 Certificate of Occupancy fee. Because it's their own home, they don't need to hire a licensed plumber — but the work still has to pass inspection by the town inspector."
