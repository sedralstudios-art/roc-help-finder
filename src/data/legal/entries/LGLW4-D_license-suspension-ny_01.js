  summary: {
    en: "New York can suspend or revoke your driver's license for a long list of reasons — unpaid traffic tickets, unpaid child support, DWI, too many points, and more. In most cases you have a right to notice and a hearing before the suspension kicks in, and many suspensions can be cleared by paying what you owe or fixing the problem."

      "Undocumented drivers with a Standard license (Green Light Law) have the same suspension rules and the same rights.",
      "Commercial drivers (CDL holders) face tougher rules — some offenses that wouldn't suspend a regular license will suspend a CDL."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "A suspension means your license is temporarily out of service. A revocation means it's canceled, and you have to re-apply when the period ends. Driving while suspended or revoked is a separate crime — Aggravated Unlicensed Operation (AUO), Vehicle and Traffic Law § 511 — and can add jail time, more fines, and more suspension time.\n\nCommon reasons the DMV suspends a New York license:\n1. Failure to answer a traffic ticket (VTL § 226, § 510).\n2. Failure to pay a traffic fine or court-ordered surcharge.\n3. DWI, DWAI, or refusing a chemical test (VTL § 1193, § 1194).\n4. Getting 11 or more points on your license in 18 months.\n5. Failure to pay child support (Social Services Law § 111-b).\n6. Failure to maintain car insurance — even for one day.\n7. Three or more speeding tickets in 18 months.\n8. Failure to appear in court after a traffic ticket.\n9. Unpaid judgment from a car accident.\n10. Medical issues reported to the DMV.\n\nFor most suspensions, the DMV has to mail you a Notice of Proposed Suspension or Order of Suspension before it takes effect. The notice tells you the reason, the date it starts, and how to request a hearing or clear the suspension.\n\nA 2021 state law (VTL § 510(4-e)) ended most debt-based suspensions for low-income drivers. If your license was suspended only because you couldn't pay a traffic fine, you may be able to get it back by entering a payment plan — without paying the full amount upfront."

      "You have the right to written notice from the DMV before a suspension takes effect (for most types).",
      "You have the right to a hearing at the DMV before a revocation in most cases (VTL § 510).",
      "You have the right to a payment plan under the 2021 reforms if the suspension is for unpaid traffic fines (VTL § 510(4-e)).",
      "You have the right to keep driving in some cases — a 'conditional license' or 'restricted use' license can let you drive to work, school, doctor, or childcare even while suspended.",
      "You have the right to a lawyer. You do not get a free court-appointed lawyer at a DMV hearing, but you can bring a private attorney or legal aid lawyer.",
      "You have the right to appeal a DMV hearing decision to the DMV Appeals Board within 60 days, and then to State Supreme Court in an Article 78 proceeding.",
      "You have the right to refuse to answer questions at a DMV hearing that could incriminate you in a criminal case.",
      "You have the right to request a copy of your full driving record (an 'abstract') from the DMV to see every suspension, point, and order on your file."

      "Get your DMV driving abstract online at dmv.ny.gov or at a DMV office. Small fee (around $10 as of April 2026 — confirm current cost at dmv.ny.gov). This tells you every open suspension and why.",
      "For unpaid traffic tickets: call the court or Traffic Violations Bureau (TVB) that issued the ticket and ask about a payment plan. Under the 2021 law, you can't be denied a plan just because you're low-income.",
      "For unpaid child support: contact the Support Collection Unit — paying part of what's owed or entering a plan usually lifts the hold.",
      "For a DWI or chemical test refusal: request a hearing right away (the deadline is short). You may be eligible for a conditional license after 30 days if you enroll in the Drinking Driver Program.",
      "For insurance lapses: get a new SR-22 insurance policy and send proof to the DMV. Pay the civil penalty set by VTL § 318 — currently about $8 per day for up to 90 days (confirm current rate at dmv.ny.gov).",

    en: "Keisha gets a Notice of Proposed Suspension from the DMV. She owes $250 on an old speeding ticket from Irondequoit Town Court. She calls the court and asks for a payment plan. Under the 2021 law, the court sets her up on $25 a month. She mails in the first payment and a signed payment plan agreement. The court clears the suspension hold with the DMV. Ten days later her license is valid again. She never had to pay the full $250 upfront."
