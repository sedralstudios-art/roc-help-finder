  summary: {
    en: "If you went to the emergency room and received a bill you cannot pay, you have options. New York law limits surprise billing, requires hospitals to offer financial assistance, and prohibits most balance billing for emergency services."

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Anyone who received an emergency room bill they cannot afford.",
      "Anyone who received a surprise bill from an out-of-network provider at an in-network hospital.",

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "New York's Surprise Bill Law (Financial Services Law Section 603) protects patients from being billed for the difference between what their insurance pays and what an out-of-network provider charges during an emergency. This is called balance billing. Under the law, the patient only owes their in-network cost-sharing amount (copay, coinsurance, or deductible). The provider and insurer must resolve the rest between themselves through an independent dispute resolution process. Separately, all New York hospitals are required to have a Financial Assistance Policy. Under Public Health Law Section 2807-k, hospitals must screen patients for charity care and offer discounts or free care to qualifying patients. If your income is below 300% of the federal poverty level, you may qualify for reduced or free hospital care. Hospitals cannot send a bill to collections without first screening the patient for financial assistance eligibility. If you are uninsured, hospitals are required to bill you at the Medicaid rate or a negotiated reduced rate rather than the full charge."

  example: {
    en: "Andre went to the ER at Strong Memorial Hospital after a car accident. He had insurance through his employer, but the ER doctor who treated him was out-of-network. Andre received a bill for $4,200 beyond what his insurance paid. He called the NYS Department of Financial Services and learned the bill violated the Surprise Bill Law. The department contacted the provider, and Andre's responsibility was reduced to his $250 in-network copay."
