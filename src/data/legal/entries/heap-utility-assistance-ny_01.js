  whatItMeans: {
    en: "HEAP is a federally funded program that helps low- and moderate-income households afford energy costs. In New York, HEAP is run by the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance. The program has several parts. The Regular HEAP Benefit helps pay for heating during winter. Benefits are paid directly to the fuel vendor or utility company, not to the household. The Emergency HEAP Benefit is available if you are in danger of running out of fuel or having your heat shut off. Cooling Assistance provides an air conditioner or fan for households with a medical need during summer. The Heating Equipment Repair and Replacement Benefit helps homeowners aged 60 and older fix or replace furnaces and boilers. HEAP operates on a first-come, first-served basis. Once funding runs out, no more applications are accepted for that season. Income limits and benefit amounts change each program year and are published on the OTDA website."

  example: {
    en: "Patricia lives in Steuben County and heats her home with fuel oil. She receives SNAP benefits, which made her automatically eligible for HEAP. She applied online in December through mybenefits.ny.gov. Her Regular HEAP benefit was paid directly to her fuel oil company. In February, she ran low on fuel during a cold stretch and contacted her local DSS office for emergency assistance. She received an Emergency HEAP benefit that covered an additional fuel delivery."
