  summary: {
    en: "A NY landlord cannot remove a tenant without a court order. The process is set by Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law Article 7. It has four stages: written notice (14 days for unpaid rent, or 30/60/90 days for non-renewal based on tenancy length under Real Property Law § 226-c); a special proceeding filed in the local court; a judgment; and a warrant executed by the sheriff or marshal with 14 more days of notice. Tenants can ask for a stay of up to one year under RPA § 753, and self-help eviction by the landlord is illegal."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "A NY eviction follows a four-stage process set by Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law Article 7. A landlord cannot lawfully lock out a tenant, shut off utilities, remove possessions, or use force to take back the property. Only a sheriff, marshal, or constable acting under a court-issued warrant can remove a tenant. Stage one — written notice. The notice depends on the reason. For unpaid rent, the landlord must serve a 14-day written demand for rent under RPA § 711(2) before filing a nonpayment case. If the landlord is not renewing the tenancy or is raising rent by 5 percent or more, RPP § 226-c requires advance notice scaled to the length of the tenancy: 30 days if the tenant has occupied less than one year, 60 days if one to two years, and 90 days if two or more years. A lease-violation (holdover) case typically requires a notice to cure followed by a notice of termination, depending on the lease terms. Stage two — special proceeding filed in local court. Eviction cases go to the city, town, or village court where the property sits. Monroe County cases go to Rochester City Court (for properties inside the city) or the relevant town or village justice court. The landlord files a petition and has it served on the tenant under the rules in RPA § 735. The tenant has the right to appear, answer in writing or orally, raise defenses, and demand a trial. Common defenses include habitability breaches (the unit is not livable), retaliation (the notice followed a good-faith complaint), improper service or defective notice, and payment of the rent before judgment. Under RPA § 744, a tenant cannot be evicted because of domestic-violence-victim status. Stage three — judgment. If the court rules for the landlord, RPA § 747 governs the entry of judgment. If the court rules for the tenant, the case is dismissed and the tenant stays. In a nonpayment case, paying the full amount owed before judgment typically ends the case. Stage four — warrant and eviction. RPA § 749 allows the court to issue a warrant directing the sheriff, marshal, or constable to remove the tenants. The officer must give the tenant at least 14 days' written notice before executing the warrant and may execute it only on a business day between sunrise and sunset. RPA § 749(2)(b) requires the officer to check for companion animals and coordinate their safe removal. RPA § 753 gives the court discretion to stay the warrant for up to one year in a dwelling case — the tenant must apply in good faith, show inability to find similar housing in the neighborhood or extreme hardship (serious illness, a child's school enrollment, other extenuating circumstances), and deposit the ongoing rent into court during the stay. Self-help eviction is illegal and expensive. A landlord who locks a tenant out, shuts off utilities, or removes possessions without a court order is liable under RPA § 853 for up to triple damages plus attorney fees. Monroe County tenants facing eviction have access to free Legal Aid Society of Rochester representation at Rochester City Court on hearing days and through phone intake."

  example: {
    en: "James rents a Rochester apartment. His landlord sent him a 30-day notice saying the tenancy would end so the landlord could renovate. James had lived there 18 months, so RPP § 226-c actually required 60 days' notice, not 30. He contacted Legal Aid Society of Rochester. A lawyer attended the Rochester City Court hearing, argued the notice was defective, and pointed out that Rochester has adopted the NY Good Cause Eviction Law — which requires a statutory reason beyond the landlord's preference to renovate. The court dismissed the petition. James kept his apartment and the landlord had to start over with a proper notice if a valid reason existed."
