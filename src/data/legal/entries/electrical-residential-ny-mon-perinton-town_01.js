  summary: {
    en: "Perinton is the OUTLIER in Monroe County — town inspectors do electrical inspections themselves. Perinton does NOT accept reports from third-party agencies. One permit, one inspector, one path. For Fairport village properties, use the village office separately."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Perinton is the only Monroe County town where the municipality does its own electrical inspections. The town explicitly rejects third-party agency reports: \"The Town of Perinton performs all electrical inspections and does not accept inspection reports from third-party agencies.\"\n\nThis is UNUSUAL. Every other Monroe County town uses third-party agencies like NYEIA, MDIA, or Commonwealth.\n\nElectrical work in Perinton uses the general Building Permit application. There's no separate electrical permit form. If your project is part of a bigger building permit (new construction, remodel), you don't need an additional form. If it's standalone (like a service upgrade), you still use the Building Permit form.\n\nHomeowners can pull their own permit. Contractor insurance (general liability, workers comp, disability) is required \"if a contractor is being used.\"\n\nFor service-level changes, the town coordinates with the utility. RG&E disconnects go through (585) 743-2110; Fairport Electric through (585) 223-9500.\n\nIMPORTANT: Fairport village has its own separate Building and Code Enforcement office. Addresses inside village limits use the village, not Perinton."

  example: {
    en: "A Perinton homeowner wants to add a hot tub. She files a Building Permit application with the town. A town electrical inspector — not a third-party agency — comes out to check the bonding and dedicated circuit. The town issues the Certificate of Compliance itself."
