  summary: {
    en: "Every vehicle driven on public roads in New York has to be registered with the DMV, pass an annual safety and emissions inspection, and carry minimum liability insurance. Vehicle and Traffic Law 401 sets the registration requirement; Vehicle and Traffic Law 301 sets the inspection requirement; Insurance Law 5101 and the DMV insurance rules require continuous coverage. Driving without any of the three is an infraction that escalates to license and registration suspension, a civil penalty, and — in severe cases — impoundment and criminal charges for driving while suspended."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Three separate statutory systems run in parallel for a car on New York roads: registration, inspection, and insurance. A lapse in any one triggers consequences in the others, because the DMV cross-checks coverage and status electronically with insurers and inspection stations.\n\nRegistration. Vehicle and Traffic Law 401 requires every motor vehicle driven on public roads to be registered with the DMV. Registration is renewed every two years. Driving with expired registration is a traffic infraction under VTL 401, with a fine and points on the license. Registration can be renewed online at dmv.ny.gov, by mail, or in person at a Monroe County DMV office in Rochester, Greece, Henrietta, or Irondequoit. The renewal requires proof of current insurance and proof of a current inspection.\n\nInspection. Vehicle and Traffic Law 301 requires every registered vehicle to pass a safety and emissions inspection at a DMV-licensed station once per year. The inspection sticker displays the month and year of expiration. A sticker that is more than 60 days past the expiration month can result in an inspection-violation ticket under VTL 306. A vehicle that fails inspection has to be repaired and re-inspected; many stations do not charge a second fee if the re-inspection is within 30 days. Emissions inspection covers tailpipe emissions for cars built since 1996 with OBD-II; safety inspection covers brakes, steering, tires, seat belts, lights, horn, and windshield wipers.\n\nLiability insurance. New York requires minimum liability insurance of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident for bodily injury and $10,000 for property damage (commonly written 25/50/10), plus $50,000 of no-fault personal injury protection and $25,000 uninsured motorist coverage. The no-fault system under Insurance Law 5101 et seq. is a defining feature of New York auto insurance — a driver's own PIP carrier pays the first $50,000 of medical bills and lost wages for driver and passengers regardless of fault. Lawsuits for pain and suffering are limited by the serious-injury threshold in Insurance Law 5102(d), though not entirely barred.\n\nLapsed-insurance enforcement. When auto insurance lapses, the insurer electronically notifies the DMV. The DMV then suspends the vehicle's registration. The suspension lasts for the number of days the vehicle was uninsured, up to 90 days. A civil penalty — $8 per day for the first 30 days, $10 per day for days 31-60, $12 per day for days 61-90 — is assessed under VTL 318 to reinstate the registration, on top of any new insurance premium. A driver caught operating a vehicle during the suspension period faces a separate charge for driving a suspended vehicle, which is more serious than the original lapse.\n\nDriving without insurance. VTL 319 makes it a misdemeanor to operate an uninsured motor vehicle on a public road. The penalty includes a fine up to $1,500, a civil penalty of $750, and a minimum one-year license revocation. Tow and impound costs are added. A driver involved in a crash while uninsured loses no-fault benefits for personal injuries under Insurance Law 5103.\n\nDriving while suspended. When a driver continues to drive after a license or registration suspension, the consequences escalate. Aggravated Unlicensed Operation (VTL 511) is charged as a misdemeanor or felony depending on prior history and aggravating factors. AUO charges carry jail exposure, additional fines, and permanent records that affect insurance premiums and employment.\n\nPayment plans and low-income options. The DMV accepts payment plans for civil penalties in some cases. The New York Automobile Insurance Plan (NYAIP) provides mandatory-market insurance for drivers who cannot obtain coverage through the regular market, often because of driving record or credit. Rates are higher but coverage is guaranteed. For low-income drivers, comparison shopping through the NY Department of Financial Services at dfs.ny.gov can surface lower-cost carriers.\n\nRochester and Monroe County. The Monroe County DMV operates multiple offices and handles in-person registration, title transfers, and inspection-station complaints. Legal Aid Society of Rochester handles traffic and registration cases for low-income drivers and can sometimes negotiate reduced civil penalties or help navigate a license-reinstatement process."

  example: {
    en: "A driver in Gates lets his insurance lapse for one month because of a tight budget. The insurance company notifies the DMV, which suspends the registration under VTL 318. He does not realize it until he is pulled over and ticketed for driving with a suspended registration. He reinstates coverage with a new insurance policy, pays the civil penalty at the DMV, and resolves the ticket in Gates Town Court. The judge reduces the fine based on the quick compliance."
