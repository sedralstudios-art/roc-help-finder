  whatItMeans: {
    en: "The Earned Income Tax Credit is one of the largest cash benefits available to working families. It is a refundable credit, which means you receive the full amount even if you owe no income tax. The federal credit amount depends on your income, filing status, and number of qualifying children. Families with more children receive a larger credit. New York State provides an additional credit equal to 30% of the federal credit amount. These credits are claimed when you file your federal and state tax returns. You do not need to apply separately. If you qualify for the federal EITC, you automatically qualify for the New York State credit. New York also offers a Non-Custodial Parent Earned Income Credit for non-custodial parents who are current on child support payments. The Empire State Child Credit may provide additional money for families with young children. Credit amounts and income limits change each year. Current figures are published by the IRS and the NYS Department of Taxation and Finance."

  example: {
    en: "David works as a warehouse associate in Monroe County and earns about $28,000 a year. He has two children. He filed his federal and state tax returns through a free VITA site at a local library. His federal EITC was several thousand dollars. His New York State credit added another 30% on top of that. He also received the Empire State Child Credit. The combined refund helped him pay for car repairs and catch up on bills. He did not have to pay anything for the tax preparation."
