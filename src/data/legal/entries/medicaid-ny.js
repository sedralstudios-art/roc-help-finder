  title: { en: "NY Medicaid — Who Qualifies, What's Covered, and How to Apply Through Two Eligibility Tracks" },

  summary: {
    en: "New York Medicaid is a free or low-cost health insurance program under federal Title XIX at 42 USC § 1396 and NY Social Services Law § 366. Coverage includes doctor visits, hospital care, prescriptions, mental health care, lab work, and medical transportation. NY runs Medicaid on two tracks. MAGI (Modified Adjusted Gross Income) covers most adults under 65, children, and pregnant people with income-only tests — no asset test. Non-MAGI covers adults 65 or older, the blind, and the disabled with both income and asset tests. Once approved, coverage lasts 12 months."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "NY Medicaid is a federal-state partnership created by Title XIX of the Social Security Act at 42 USC § 1396. The federal government funds most of the cost; NY contributes a state share and administers the program through Social Services Law § 366 and 366-a. NY Medicaid covers a wide range of services: primary-care visits, specialist care, hospital inpatient and outpatient services, emergency room care, prescriptions, mental health treatment, substance use treatment, lab work, X-rays, medical transportation (including ambulance and non-emergency transport to appointments), home care for eligible individuals, nursing-home care, and family-planning services. Children receive full dental, vision, hearing, and developmental screenings through the EPSDT (Early Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment) benefit. Adult dental is more limited but includes cleanings, extractions, fillings, and medically necessary procedures. NY uses two parallel eligibility tracks. The MAGI track applies to most adults under 65, children, and pregnant people. MAGI stands for Modified Adjusted Gross Income — an income-only test with no look at savings, home equity, vehicles, or other assets. MAGI-pathway applications go through NY State of Health, the state-run health-insurance marketplace at nystateofhealth.ny.gov. The Non-MAGI track applies to adults 65 or older, the blind, the disabled, and related categories. Non-MAGI applies both income and asset tests, with extensive exclusions (primary home, one car, retirement accounts in payout status, household belongings). Non-MAGI applications go to the local social services district — Monroe County DHS for Monroe County residents. The separate disability-medicaid-ny entry covers the Non-MAGI pathway in detail, including the Medicaid Buy-In for Working People with Disabilities, spend-down, and pooled trust options. Once approved, coverage is continuous for 12 months even if household income rises during that period — NY's continuous-eligibility rule matches the federal requirement. Decision timeframes are 45 days for routine applications and up to 90 days when a disability determination is required. Under SSL § 366-a, applicants with immediate need for personal-care services are entitled to expedited determinations within 7 days. Applications can be denied for exceeding income/asset limits, missing documentation, failing to return verifications, or not meeting categorical criteria. Denials, reductions, and closures can be appealed through the NY fair hearing process under SSL § 22 within 60 days. Aid continuing keeps benefits intact during the appeal when the hearing is requested before the effective date. Beyond Medicaid, NY offers two programs for households with income just above Medicaid limits: Child Health Plus covers children in households up to 400% of the federal poverty level (sliding-scale premium), and the Essential Plan covers adults through NY State of Health with free or very low-cost coverage. Legal Aid Society of Rochester, LawNY, and Empire Justice Center represent low-income Monroe County residents in applications, denials, and fair hearings."

  example: {
    en: "Darnell is 34 and works part-time at a Monroe County warehouse. He earns about $1,200 per month and has no other income. He applied online through NY State of Health — the MAGI pathway for adults under 65. Because his income is below the 138% FPL threshold for a single adult, he was approved about three weeks later. A NY Medicaid ID card arrived by mail. He now sees a primary-care doctor for a condition he had been putting off for two years. Prescriptions, lab work, specialist referrals, and appointments are fully covered. Under the 12-month continuous-eligibility rule, his coverage stays active for a full year even if his hours increase."
