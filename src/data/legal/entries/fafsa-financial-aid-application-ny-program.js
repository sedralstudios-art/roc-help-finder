  summary: {
    en: "The FAFSA is the single application that unlocks federal Pell Grants, federal student loans, work-study, most state aid (TAP in New York), and most college-based aid. It is free. The form reopens each October 1 for the following academic year, and a new FAFSA is required each year a student is enrolled. Not filing costs families thousands in lost grants."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the U.S. Department of Education application at studentaid.gov. It collects household and student income, asset, and demographic information to calculate the Student Aid Index (SAI) — replacing the older Expected Family Contribution. The SAI is used by federal, state, and institutional programs to determine aid eligibility. Filing the FAFSA opens access to Pell Grants (up to about $7,395 per year in 2024-2025, need-based, no repayment), Federal Direct Loans (subsidized and unsubsidized, with annual limits), Work-Study (part-time employment tied to financial need), state aid programs like New York's TAP (see separate tap-tuition-assistance-program-ny-program entry), and most institutional scholarships — many colleges require FAFSA data to award their own aid. The FAFSA is free. Paid services that charge to complete it are not necessary. The form reopens October 1 each year for the following academic year (though recent years have had delays). Students file a new FAFSA every year in school. Dependent students (most undergraduates under 24) must report parent income; independent students (age 24+, married, veterans, parents of dependents, foster youth, homeless youth) report their own. The 2024-2025 form was a major redesign under the FAFSA Simplification Act. The form uses tax data from the prior-prior year (e.g., the 2024-2025 form uses 2022 tax returns), often imported directly from the IRS. Common mistakes: missing the state or college priority deadline (earlier than federal deadline), forgetting to file for a second parent after divorce, and not updating when family circumstances change. Colleges can perform a professional judgment review for families with major income changes not reflected in the tax return. Verification is a separate process that affects about 30 percent of FAFSA filers each year. The financial aid office may request additional documentation to verify income, household size, or other application items. Failure to respond to a verification request can delay or eliminate aid. Tax transcripts (free from the IRS) are the most commonly requested documentation. Federal student loan interest rates are reset each year by the Department of Education and are typically lower than private loans. Subsidized loans (interest paid by the government during enrollment) are need-based; unsubsidized loans accrue interest from disbursement and are available without need. Both have annual and aggregate limits that vary by year in school and dependency status. Parent PLUS loans allow parents of dependent students to borrow up to the cost of attendance minus other aid; rates are higher than direct loans and credit approval is required. Private student loans should generally be a last resort because they lack the borrower protections of federal loans."

  example: {
    en: "A single father in Rochester had a daughter starting at Monroe Community College. He nearly skipped the FAFSA because he thought his income was too high to qualify. At the high school's Financial Aid Night in November, a counselor walked him through the form at studentaid.gov. His daughter was approved for a Pell Grant of about $4,400 based on their income, plus TAP of about $3,800. Combined, the aid covered all tuition and fees, with money left over for books. The entire FAFSA took about 45 minutes including importing tax data from the IRS. No fee, no repayment."
