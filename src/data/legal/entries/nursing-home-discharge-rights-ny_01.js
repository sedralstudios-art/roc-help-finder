  summary: {
    en: "A nursing home cannot just kick a resident out. Federal and state law require advance notice, a valid reason, and give the resident the right to appeal. If the discharge is unsafe or the resident has nowhere to go, the facility may be required to keep them."
  },

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Any nursing home resident who was told they are being discharged or transferred.",
      "Any family member of a nursing home resident facing discharge.",
      "Any resident being moved to a different facility without their consent.",
      "Any resident whose Medicaid or Medicare is running out and the facility says they must leave."
    ]
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Under federal law (42 CFR Section 483.15) and New York Public Health Law Section 2801-d, a nursing home can only discharge or transfer a resident for specific reasons: the resident's health has improved enough that they no longer need nursing home care, the resident's needs cannot be met at the facility, the resident's presence endangers others, the resident has not paid after reasonable notice, or the facility is closing. The facility must give at least 30 days written notice before the discharge. The notice must explain the reason, the date, the location the resident will be transferred to, and the right to appeal. A resident who disagrees with the discharge can request a hearing from the NYS Department of Health. If the resident requests a hearing before the discharge date, they have the right to stay in the facility until the hearing is resolved. A facility cannot discharge a resident simply because their Medicare days ran out and they switched to Medicaid. Once a facility accepts Medicaid, it must keep Medicaid residents."

  example: {
    en: "Dorothy's mother had been in a nursing home for six months under Medicare. When her Medicare coverage ended and she switched to Medicaid, the facility told the family she needed to leave. Dorothy called the Long Term Care Ombudsman, who explained that the facility could not discharge her mother just because she moved to Medicaid. The Ombudsman contacted the facility, cited the federal rule, and the discharge was stopped. Dorothy's mother stayed at the same facility under Medicaid."
