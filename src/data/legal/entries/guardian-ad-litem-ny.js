  title: { en: "Guardian Ad Litem — Court-Appointed Representative for a Person Unable to Protect Their Own Interests" },

  summary: {
    en: "A guardian ad litem (GAL) is a person appointed by a court to represent the interests of someone who cannot represent themselves in a lawsuit — a minor, a person with a mental or cognitive disability, or an absent party. The GAL is not a guardian in the full sense; the role ends when the case ends. New York CPLR Article 12 governs GAL appointments in civil cases, while SCPA 403 governs them in Surrogate's Court. Family Court uses the related role of attorney for the child (AFC) under Family Court Act 241."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "CPLR 1201 requires that a person under disability — an infant (under 18), a person judicially declared incompetent, or a person for whom a committee or conservator has been appointed — appear by a representative. CPLR 1202 lets the court appoint a GAL when no natural guardian or general guardian is available or willing. The GAL can be an attorney, a family member, or a neutral third party. CPLR 1203 requires that the GAL act in the best interests of the person represented and that any settlement of an infant's claim be approved by court order (CPLR 1207). CPLR 1204 covers GAL compensation, typically paid from the represented party's recovery or from the opposing party in specific situations. In Surrogate's Court, SCPA 403 authorizes appointment of a GAL for a person under disability in estate proceedings. This commonly happens when a minor or incapacitated adult is a will beneficiary or distributee. In mortgage foreclosure actions, CPLR 1201 combined with RPAPL 1321 often triggers a GAL appointment when the defendant homeowner cannot meaningfully respond. Family Court uses a different role: the attorney for the child (AFC) under Family Court Act Section 241. An AFC represents the child's wishes (not just best interests) in custody, visitation, abuse/neglect, and juvenile delinquency cases. AFCs are appointed in most contested Family Court matters involving children. Selection: the court typically appoints from a panel of qualified attorneys who have completed required training (22 NYCRR 36 for fiduciary appointments). The appointee files a consent to act. Duties: investigate the facts, consult with the represented person if possible, file answers or motions, attend hearings, and report to the court. The GAL's role is to protect the person's legal interests in the pending case — not to make long-term life decisions. Discharge: the GAL's authority ends when the case is resolved, unless the court continues it for post-judgment matters (for example, holding settlement funds in a Surrogate's Court guardianship for a minor)."

  example: {
    en: "An 82-year-old Irondequoit widow with advanced dementia was named as a defendant in a mortgage foreclosure after her late husband's estate lapsed on payments. The bank moved for default judgment when she did not appear. Her daughter contacted Legal Aid, which petitioned for appointment of a guardian ad litem under CPLR 1201 and 1202. The court appointed a panel attorney as GAL. The GAL filed an answer asserting the protections of RPAPL 1304 (the 90-day pre-foreclosure notice) and a loan modification request. The foreclosure was stayed while the estate was probated and a full Article 81 guardianship was obtained for the mother. The GAL's role ended when the Article 81 guardian was appointed."
