  title: { en: "Reaffirmation Agreements — Keeping a Secured Asset After Bankruptcy" },

  summary: {
    en: "A reaffirmation agreement is a contract that keeps a specific debt alive after your bankruptcy discharge. It is most common with car loans. Reaffirmation can be risky — especially when you owe more than the property is worth."
  },

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Anyone filing Chapter 7 who has a secured debt such as a car loan",
      "A lender may ask you to reaffirm your car or home loan. There is no reason to reaffirm a home loan unless the lender offers a benefit for doing so. There is a risk of repossession if you do not reaffirm a car loan (or other purchase money personal property loan).",
      "Reaffirmation is voluntary — no creditor can force you to sign",
      "The reaffirmation agreement must be filed with the bankruptcy court. It must be approved by your lawyer if you have one, or approved by the court after a hearing if you do not have a lawyer."
    ]
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "A reaffirmation agreement (11 U.S.C. § 524(c)) voluntarily excludes one debt from your discharge. You agree to remain personally liable for that debt even after bankruptcy. If you later default on a reaffirmed debt, the lender can repossess the property and sue you for the difference. Without reaffirmation, that deficiency would have been discharged."
  },

  yourRights: {
    en: [
      "Reaffirmation is voluntary. No creditor can force you to sign.",
      "You can rescind a reaffirmation agreement within 60 days of signing or before the discharge, whichever is later.",
      "If you are not represented by an attorney, the court must review the agreement and can reject it if it creates a hardship.",
      "Many lenders accept continued payments without a reaffirmation agreement — repossession is not automatic.",
      "If the property is worth more than the debt, reaffirmation may be reasonable. If you owe more than the property is worth, reaffirmation is risky."
    ]
  },

  legalOptions: {
    en: [
      "If represented by an attorney, the attorney must certify that reaffirmation is not a hardship before signing.",
      "Many attorneys will not sign a reaffirmation agreement if the property is worth less than the debt.",
      "The Bankruptcy Code allows purchase money personal property lenders (such as car lenders) to enforce \"ipso facto\" default-upon-filing clauses (11 U.S.C. § 521(d)), but state court enforcement is uncertain.",
      "Even though purchase money car lenders may be able to enforce default-upon-bankruptcy clauses, many will accept payments rather than incurring a certain loss by repossession. Debtors should not feel coerced into reaffirmation if the collateral is worth less than the debt.",
      "Free legal help is available through Legal Aid Society of Rochester at (585) 232-4090.",
      "Empire Justice Center in Rochester provides consumer and bankruptcy legal assistance at (585) 454-4060."

  example: {
    en: "Kevin files Chapter 7. He owes $9,000 on his car, which is worth $8,200 — he is underwater. His lender asks him to reaffirm the car loan. He thinks it through: if he reaffirms and later cannot make payments, the lender can repossess the car and sue him for the difference. Without reaffirmation, the risk of liability for a deficiency disappears. Most lenders would rather receive payments than repossess at a loss. Kevin keeps making payments without reaffirming and accepts the small risk that the lender could repossess."
