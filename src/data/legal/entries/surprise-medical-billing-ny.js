  title: { en: "Surprise Medical Bills — The No Surprises Act and Patient Rights" },

  summary: {
    en: "A surprise medical bill is a bill from an out-of-network provider that the patient did not choose — like an ER doctor, anesthesiologist, or lab that happened to be out of network at an in-network hospital. The federal No Surprises Act (2022) and New York's earlier surprise bill law protect patients from being charged more than their in-network cost-sharing in these situations."

      "Anyone who received a bill from an out-of-network provider at an in-network facility (hospital, surgery center, etc.).",
      "Anyone treated in an emergency department — all emergency services are protected regardless of network status.",
      "Anyone who received an unexpectedly high bill because a provider they did not choose turned out to be out of network.",

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Before the No Surprises Act, a patient could go to an in-network hospital for surgery and receive a bill for thousands of dollars from the anesthesiologist or assistant surgeon who happened to be out of network — even though the patient had no choice in the matter. Under the No Surprises Act (effective January 2022) and New York's earlier surprise bill law (Financial Services Law § 603), the patient's responsibility is limited to their in-network cost-sharing amount (co-pay, deductible, coinsurance). The provider and the insurance company work out the payment between themselves. The patient is removed from the middle. This applies to: emergency services at any facility, non-emergency services at an in-network facility from an out-of-network provider the patient did not choose, and air ambulance services. If a patient receives a surprise bill, they can dispute it. The insurer must send an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) showing the in-network amount the patient owes. If the provider bills more than that, the patient can file a complaint."

      "In emergency situations, the patient can only be charged the in-network cost-sharing amount — regardless of whether the provider or facility is in network.",
      "At in-network facilities, out-of-network providers the patient did not choose cannot balance-bill the patient beyond the in-network amount.",
      "The patient has the right to an Explanation of Benefits showing what they actually owe.",
      "If a surprise bill is received, a complaint can be filed with the insurer, the NY Department of Financial Services, or the federal No Surprises Act helpline.",
      "Providers must give a Good Faith Estimate of costs before scheduled services for uninsured or self-pay patients."

  example: {
    en: "A woman goes to an in-network hospital in Rochester for a scheduled knee surgery. The surgeon is in-network, but the anesthesiologist turns out to be out of network. She receives a $4,200 bill from the anesthesiologist's billing company. She calls her insurance company and asks them to reprocess under the No Surprises Act. The insurer determines her in-network responsibility is $350 (her co-pay). The remaining $3,850 is resolved between the insurer and the anesthesiologist. The patient pays only $350."
