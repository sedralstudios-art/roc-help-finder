  whatItMeans: {
    en: "New York Public Health Law Section 4174 and 10 NYCRR Part 35 govern the issuance of vital records certificates. Vital records include birth certificates, death certificates, marriage certificates, divorce certificates, and fetal death certificates. For events that occurred outside New York City, the NY State Department of Health Vital Records Section in Albany issues certificates. For events in the 5 boroughs of New York City, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issues certificates separately. Monroe County residents who were born, married, or divorced in NY outside NYC (including in Rochester or any Monroe County municipality) request through the state office. A certified copy (the official paper document with the state seal suitable for passport applications, Social Security, immigration, etc.) costs 30 dollars through the standard process or up to 45 dollars for expedited. A short-form or informational copy may be available but is not acceptable for most official purposes. Basic request options: (1) Online at health.ny.gov through VitalChek, a third-party service — adds a convenience fee but is fastest (delivered in 1 to 2 weeks), (2) By mail with check and Form DOH-297 — typical processing 3 to 6 weeks, (3) In person at the state vital records office in Menands near Albany or at a local county clerk in some cases for records pertaining to their county. Eligibility is important. The person named on the certificate can always request. Immediate family (parent, spouse, sibling, adult child, grandparent) can request with proof of relationship. An attorney or legal representative needs written authorization. A genealogist researching family history can request records after the privacy period expires — 75 years for births or 50 years for deaths. A person who was adopted has access to the original pre-adoption birth certificate under NY Adoption Records Law (Public Health Law 4138-e) without restriction since 2020. Adoptees can request the original birth certificate from Vital Records to identify biological parents and trace genealogy. Death certificates are generally available to the next of kin, executor, or administrator of the estate, and law enforcement. Marriage certificates are available to either spouse, and to any immediate family after the marriage has been filed. Divorce certificates (different from divorce decrees, which are court documents) are available to either spouse after the divorce is final and filed with Vital Records. Rush / expedited service delivers within 3 business days for an extra 15 dollar fee. Same-day in-person pickup is available only if traveling to the state office in Menands NY — not feasible for most Monroe County residents. For a lost or damaged certificate, a replacement is simply another request. Certified copies can be ordered in bulk (for example, for an estate requiring multiple death certificates for banks, insurers, retirement accounts). Each copy costs the full fee. A Monroe County resident needing a birth certificate for a passport, job, or school should allow 4 to 6 weeks for standard mail ordering or 2 weeks with online VitalChek. Common issues: mismatched names between the request and the record (a married name vs birth name), missing or incomplete information on the request form, or uncertainty about when and where the event occurred. The Vital Records Search function at health.ny.gov/vital_records helps locate a record when the date or location is uncertain. For records of events in NYC, the NYC process is separate at [number being verified] or nyc.gov/health/vital-records. For international citizens needing NY certificates legalized for use overseas, an apostille from the NY Department of State is often required after the certified copy."

    en: "Rosalind needed a certified copy of her son's Rochester birth certificate for a passport application and a copy of her own birth certificate to prove identity for the passport. She ordered both online through VitalChek for a total of 85 dollars (30 dollars per certificate plus VitalChek processing fees). Both arrived in the mail within 9 days. She used them for her son's passport application and her own Real ID renewal at DMV."
