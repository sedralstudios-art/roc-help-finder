  summary: {
    en: "If a driver's license is suspended in New York, driving on it is a crime. But in some cases a person can apply for a restricted-use license that allows driving to work, school, or medical appointments. The rules depend on why the license was suspended."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "When a license is suspended, it means the driving privilege has been taken away temporarily. Driving on a suspended license is a crime under Vehicle and Traffic Law Section 511. A first offense is a misdemeanor with a fine of $200 to $500 and possible jail time of up to 30 days. A third offense within 18 months is a felony. However, the DMV offers a conditional license (sometimes called a restricted license) for some suspensions. A conditional license allows driving to and from work, school, medical appointments, court-ordered programs, and child care. It does not allow general personal driving. To get a conditional license, the driver usually must enroll in the DMV's Driver Responsibility Assessment program or complete a Point and Insurance Reduction Program (PIRP) course. A conditional license is not available for all suspensions. It is generally not available for suspensions related to DWI refusal, three or more alcohol-related offenses, or certain mandatory revocations. For DWI-related revocations, the court may grant a conditional discharge that includes limited driving privileges through the DMV's Drinking Driver Program."

  example: {
    en: "Kenji's license was suspended after he got 12 points on his record from multiple speeding tickets. He needed to drive to work at a factory in Gates because there was no bus route. Kenji enrolled in a PIRP course online, which took four points off his record. He applied for a conditional license through the DMV, which allowed him to drive to and from work and to his daughter's daycare. He could not use it for personal errands. After the suspension period ended and he paid his fines, his full license was restored."
