  title: { en: "Changing the Locks — A Tenant's Right in New York, Especially After Domestic Violence" },

  summary: {
    en: "A tenant generally has the right to change the apartment locks without the landlord's permission, as long as a copy of the new key is provided to the landlord. For tenants who are domestic violence survivors, New York law also provides the right to terminate the lease early (RPL 227-c) and protects against landlord discrimination based on DV status (RPL 227-d). A landlord cannot punish a tenant for taking steps to stay safe."

      "Any tenant who feels unsafe and wants to change the locks.",
      "Any tenant who has an order of protection against a household member or former partner.",

      "Any tenant whose landlord is threatening entry in bad faith."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "A residential tenant has a common-law right to exclusive possession of the leased premises. Most leases require the landlord to have access for maintenance and emergencies, but the landlord cannot keep a key that allows unannounced entry. A tenant can change the locks as long as the landlord receives a working key within a reasonable time. New York does not currently have an enacted statute that requires the landlord to change locks at the landlord's expense for a DV survivor — bills proposing that requirement (most recently introduced as RPL Section 238-b) have been considered but not enacted. What NY law does provide for DV survivors: under Real Property Law Section 227-c, a tenant who is a DV victim may terminate the residential lease early on at least 30 days written notice with proper documentation of the violence. Under Section 227-d, a landlord cannot deny housing, evict, or otherwise penalize a tenant based on actual or perceived domestic violence victim status (a misdemeanor with a fine of $1,000 to $2,000 per offense). The lock-change right itself comes from the common law of exclusive possession — most courts respect it if a working key is provided to the landlord, but landlords sometimes contest it. Written notice to the landlord of intent to change locks, followed by delivery of a new key, is the strongest posture. A tenant on the lease with an abuser is not required to give the abuser a key once the abuser has been excluded by an order of protection — the order itself bars the abuser from the home. The abuser may remain responsible for rent if also on the lease. Landlord retaliation for a lock change — even an unauthorized one — runs into the same anti-retaliation rules that cover other tenant complaints under RPL 223-b. A late-payment notice, a sudden inspection demand, or a non-renewal that follows a lock change creates a presumption of retaliation if the timing is close. Smart locks add a wrinkle. Some landlords now install electronic locks that allow remote access; a tenant who finds a smart lock on the door can request that the landlord disable any remote-entry feature so the tenant has actual exclusive possession. Smart locks also create privacy concerns about access logs — a landlord that can see when the tenant comes and goes is collecting personal information that may not be permitted under the lease. For tenants in DV situations who do not yet have an order of protection, contacting Willow or RESTORE first is often the safest sequence — the advocate can help with safety planning and accelerate the order while coordinating with the landlord on locks."

  example: {
    en: "After obtaining an order of protection against her estranged husband, a tenant in Brighton sent her landlord a written request asking that the locks be changed and attached a copy of the order. The landlord agreed and arranged for a locksmith; the tenant paid the $120 bill. The husband, who was on the lease, remained responsible for rent but was barred from entering by the order of protection. When he tried to contest the lock change, the court found the order itself excluded him from the premises."
