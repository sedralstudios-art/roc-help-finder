  summary: {
    en: "IMPORTANT: Plumbing permits for properties inside Spencerport are handled by the Town of Ogden Building Department — NOT by the Village. The Village Code Enforcement officer only handles property-maintenance issues (things like junk vehicles, unkempt properties, signage)."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Spencerport is a village inside the Town of Ogden. The Village does not run its own building or plumbing permit process. Instead, it hands all of that off to the Town of Ogden Building Department.\n\nSo if you need a plumbing permit for a property inside Spencerport — water heater, fixtures, sewer line, whatever — you go to Ogden, not the village.\n\nThe Village's Code Enforcement office handles other things: property maintenance, junk vehicles, signs, refuse complaints. If you have a question about those, call the village at (585) 352-4771.\n\nFor plumbing, see the Town of Ogden Building Department at (585) 617-6195."

  example: {
    en: "A homeowner in Spencerport village wants to replace their water heater. They call the village and are told plumbing permits are handled by Ogden. They go to the Town of Ogden Building Department, file a plumbing permit there, and the town inspector signs off on the work."
