  title: { en: "NY Rights When Arrested — Silence, Counsel, and the Road to Arraignment" },

  summary: {
    en: "A person arrested in New York has four core rights: the right to know the charge, the right to remain silent, the right to counsel at police questioning and arraignment, and the right to be brought before a judge without unnecessary delay. The Miranda rights derive from the U.S. Constitution. NY Criminal Procedure Law § 170.10 sets the arraignment procedure. Bail rules are at Criminal Procedure Law § 510.10. Statements obtained in violation of Miranda are suppressible under Criminal Procedure Law § 710.20. These protections apply regardless of citizenship or immigration status."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "A person arrested in New York has four core rights that the police must respect. Right to know the charge. The police must tell the arrestee why the arrest is being made. A failure to state a lawful reason can give grounds for a later challenge, but does not by itself invalidate the arrest if probable cause actually existed. Right to remain silent. The Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination applies at custodial interrogation. Miranda v. Arizona requires the police to warn a person in custody, before questioning, of the right to remain silent, that anything said can be used in court, the right to counsel, and the right to free appointed counsel if unable to afford private counsel. The arrestee can invoke silence by clearly saying so — simply being silent is not enough under Berghuis v. Thompkins. NY also extends the right under People v. Rogers: once the person has counsel on any pending matter, police cannot question the person on any other matter without counsel present. Right to counsel. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches at the initiation of adversarial proceedings — generally at arraignment. Miranda's interrogation-stage right to counsel attaches earlier, during custodial police questioning. Once the person asks for a lawyer, police questioning must stop until a lawyer is present. The arrestee cannot be questioned further — the person cannot waive that right by simply continuing to talk. If a lawyer cannot be afforded, the court appoints a public defender or 18-B Assigned Counsel attorney at arraignment at no cost. Right to arraignment without unnecessary delay. Under NY Criminal Procedure Law § 140.20, a person arrested without a warrant must be brought before a magistrate without unnecessary delay — generally interpreted as within 24 hours under NY case law (People ex rel. Maxian v. Brown). Criminal Procedure Law § 170.10 governs the arraignment on a misdemeanor or violation; Criminal Procedure Law § 180.10 covers felony arraignments. At arraignment the judge states the charges, advises of the right to counsel, accepts or assigns a lawyer, takes a plea (usually not guilty at first), and decides release conditions under Criminal Procedure Law § 510.10. Bail reform. NY Criminal Procedure Law § 510.10 underwent major reforms starting 2020. Most misdemeanors and many non-violent felonies are non-bail-eligible — the court must release on recognizance or with supervised release. Bail may only be set for offenses listed as bail-eligible in the statute (qualifying offenses). Search and seizure. An arrestee has the right to refuse consent to searches of the person, home, vehicle, or belongings. Police typically need a warrant supported by probable cause, with narrow exceptions (search incident to arrest, exigent circumstances, automobile exception, plain view, consent, inventory). Refusing consent does not create probable cause. Miranda suppression. Statements obtained in violation of Miranda are suppressible — the prosecution cannot use them in its case-in-chief. The suppression remedy is pursued through a defense motion under Criminal Procedure Law § 710.20 and a Huntley hearing (People v. Huntley). A Miranda violation does not automatically invalidate the arrest — the arrest can still be lawful even if a statement is suppressed. Phone calls. A NY arrestee has the right to reasonable phone calls after booking — typically one to a lawyer and one to a family member or friend. Practical posture: identify, say nothing substantive, clearly invoke silence and counsel, do not consent to searches, and wait for a lawyer at arraignment.

  example: {
    en: "Marcus was stopped by police in Monroe County and arrested on a misdemeanor charge. At the precinct, officers read him Miranda warnings and began questioning him. Marcus stated clearly that he wanted a lawyer and would not answer questions. The officers stopped questioning — any further questioning would violate Miranda and render the statements suppressible under Criminal Procedure Law § 710.20. At arraignment the next morning (within the Criminal Procedure Law § 140.20 without-unnecessary-delay window), the Rochester City Court judge read the charge, appointed a Monroe County Public Defender under County Law § 722, took Marcus's not-guilty plea, and set release conditions under Criminal Procedure Law § 510.10. Because the charge was a non-violent misdemeanor, the court released Marcus on his own recognizance."
