  summary: {
    en: "If someone has a medical emergency and no insurance, Emergency Medicaid can cover the cost — including for undocumented immigrants who would not otherwise qualify for full Medicaid. Emergency Medicaid covers emergency room visits, emergency surgery, labor and delivery, and other emergency treatment. It can also be applied retroactively up to 3 months before the application date."
  },

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Anyone who has a medical emergency and meets Medicaid income requirements but is not otherwise eligible for full Medicaid — most commonly undocumented immigrants.",
      "Documented immigrants in the 5-year waiting period for full Medicaid may also qualify for Emergency Medicaid.",
      "Anyone who was uninsured at the time of an emergency and applies for Medicaid within 3 months can have coverage applied retroactively."
    ]
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Emergency Medicaid is a federally mandated program (42 USC § 1396b(v)) that requires states to cover emergency medical treatment for people who meet Medicaid financial criteria but are ineligible for full Medicaid due to immigration status. In New York, Emergency Medicaid covers: emergency room care, emergency surgery, labor and delivery (the birth itself), dialysis in some emergency situations, and other conditions that pose an immediate threat to life or health. It does NOT cover non-emergency follow-up care, prescriptions, or preventive services. The application is the same as a regular Medicaid application — filed at the county DSS or online at mybenefits.ny.gov. The emergency is documented by the treating hospital. Retroactive coverage: any person who qualifies for Medicaid (including full Medicaid for citizens and eligible immigrants) can have coverage applied retroactively to cover bills from the 3 months before the application date. This means if someone goes to the ER uninsured and applies for Medicaid within 90 days, the ER bill can be covered retroactively."

      "The hospital must document the emergency condition on the application. Hospitals that treat Medicaid-eligible patients have an incentive to help with the paperwork because Medicaid pays the bill.",
      "For retroactive coverage of past emergency bills, the application should note the dates of service. Coverage can go back up to 3 months.",

  example: {
    en: "An undocumented woman in Rochester goes into labor and delivers her baby at Strong Memorial Hospital. She has no insurance. The hospital's financial counselor helps her apply for Emergency Medicaid, which covers the delivery. The baby, born in the US, is a citizen and qualifies for full Medicaid on their own. The mother's Emergency Medicaid covers only the delivery and immediate post-delivery care — not ongoing medical visits."
