  summary: {
    en: "Medicaid is a free or low-cost health insurance program for people with low income. New York expanded Medicaid so that most adults under 65 can qualify based on income alone, with no savings or asset test."

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Adults aged 19 to 64 with household income at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level.",
      "Pregnant women with household income at or below 223% of the Federal Poverty Level.",
      "Infants under age 1 with household income at or below 223% of the Federal Poverty Level.",

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Medicaid pays for a wide range of health care services. This includes doctor visits, hospital stays, emergency room visits, and prescription drugs. It also covers mental health treatment, substance use treatment, lab tests, X-rays, and medical transportation. For children, Medicaid also covers dental care, vision, hearing, and developmental screenings. Dental coverage for adults is limited but available for certain services. New York uses two sets of rules to determine eligibility. For most people under 65, the state uses MAGI rules. MAGI stands for Modified Adjusted Gross Income. Under MAGI, only income matters — there is no test for savings, property, or other assets. For people aged 65 and older and people with certain disabilities, New York uses Non-MAGI rules. Under Non-MAGI, both income and assets are counted. Once approved, Medicaid coverage continues for 12 months even if income changes during that period. Income limits and asset thresholds are updated each year. Current figures are published on the NY State of Health website and by the NYS Department of Health."

  example: {
    en: "Darnell is 34 and works part-time at a warehouse in Monroe County. He earns about $1,200 a month and has no other income. He applied for Medicaid online through NY State of Health. Because his income is below the limit for a single adult, he was approved within three weeks. His Medicaid card arrived by mail. He now sees a doctor for a condition he had been putting off for two years. His prescriptions, lab work, and appointments are fully covered."
