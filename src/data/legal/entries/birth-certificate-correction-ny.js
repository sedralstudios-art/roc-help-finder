  summary: {
    en: "Birth certificates sometimes contain errors — a misspelled name, incorrect date, wrong parent listed, or missing information. New York allows corrections and amendments through the Department of Health (for births outside NYC) or the NYC Department of Health (for NYC births). Some changes are administrative (simple corrections) and some require a court order. Understanding which process applies determines how long it takes and what it costs."
  },

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Any person whose birth certificate contains an error — name spelling, date of birth, parent information, place of birth.",
      "Any person who needs to add a parent (paternity acknowledgment) or remove a parent from the birth certificate.",
      "Any person seeking to change the gender designation on their birth certificate (see the gender marker change entry for details).",
      "Parents, legal guardians, or the person themselves (if 18 or older) can request corrections."
    ]
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "For births registered in New York State (outside NYC): the NY Department of Health Vital Records Section handles corrections. Minor clerical errors (misspellings, transposed numbers) can be corrected administratively by submitting an Application for Correction along with supporting documents (hospital records, other IDs showing the correct information). More substantial changes — adding or changing a parent's name, changing the child's surname, correcting the date of birth when records conflict — may require a court order from the Supreme Court or Family Court. For births registered in New York City: the NYC Department of Health has its own process and forms, which are similar but separate. Adding a father to a birth certificate can be done by filing an Acknowledgment of Paternity — both parents sign the form, and the birth certificate is amended to include the father. This can be done at the hospital at birth or at any time afterward through Vital Records. If there is a dispute about paternity, a Family Court order is required. The fee for amending a birth certificate varies — check with the issuing agency for current fees. Fee waivers may be available in some circumstances."

      "If a court order is required, the court cannot deny the correction if the evidence supports it."

  example: {
    en: "A man born in Rochester discovers that his birth certificate has his first name misspelled — 'Joesph' instead of 'Joseph.' He contacts the NY Department of Health Vital Records, submits the correction application with a copy of his hospital birth record showing the correct spelling, and receives a corrected birth certificate. The correction is administrative — no court order is needed."
