  summary: {
    en: "New York does not require stores to accept returns. It does require stores to post their return policy clearly. When a store posts no policy, the statute kicks in with a default: the customer has 20 days to return merchandise in original condition for a full refund. Many stores try to enforce 'all sales final' without posting it — that doesn't work under GBL 218-a. Defective merchandise is separate: a store cannot refuse a return of defective goods under the implied warranty of merchantability (Uniform Commercial Code § 2-314) regardless of the posted policy."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "General Business Law 218-a is the core statute. It does not force a retailer to accept returns, but it requires the retailer to tell customers, in advance, what the return policy actually is. When the retailer does not post a policy, a statutory default kicks in.\n\nThe disclosure rule. A retail store has to conspicuously post its refund and return policy at the point of sale. 'Conspicuously' means the sign is visible to a customer deciding to buy. A policy printed only on the receipt does not count, because the customer sees the receipt after the purchase is done. An in-store sign at the register, a prominent sign at the entrance, or a sign on the product itself typically does the job.\n\nThe default when no policy is posted. When the retailer has not posted a policy, GBL 218-a gives the customer 20 days from the date of purchase to return the merchandise in original condition. The refund has to be in cash (or the form of the original payment) unless the customer chooses an exchange or store credit.\n\nEnforceable policies. When the store does post a policy, that policy controls. Common enforceable forms: '14-day returns for a full refund,' 'exchange only,' 'store credit only,' 'final sale — no returns,' 'store credit after 30 days.' The key is that the policy was visible at the time of purchase.\n\nReceipt requirements. A posted policy can require a receipt for a refund. A policy that requires a receipt has to say so clearly. A store that normally takes returns without receipts cannot suddenly demand one to defeat a specific return.\n\nExempt categories. Some categories are exempt from 218-a or carry their own rules: food, perishable goods, custom-made items, sale items marked 'final sale' at the point of sale, health-sensitive items (undergarments, swimwear), and items from a going-out-of-business sale.\n\nOnline orders. GBL 218-a's posting rule is about brick-and-mortar retail. Online sellers are governed by the policy they show on the product page or at checkout. The FTC Mail Order Rule (16 CFR 435) adds federal timing requirements for mail and online sellers. Many online sellers voluntarily offer 30- or 90-day return windows to compete.\n\nDefective merchandise. A store cannot sell a defective product and then refuse to take it back by pointing to 'all sales final.' The UCC's implied warranty of merchantability (Uniform Commercial Code § 2-314) applies to every retail sale by a merchant in goods of that kind. A defective item entitles the buyer to a remedy — repair, replacement, or refund. The implied warranty can only be disclaimed with conspicuous 'as is' language; a 'final sale' label alone does not disclaim it.\n\nGift cards. Gift cards are handled separately under GBL 5-702 — see the gift-card-rights-ny entry. The return policy on merchandise is a different body of law.\n\nRemedies for violations. A store that refuses a proper return can be reported to the NYS Attorney General's Consumer Frauds Bureau. A consumer with a specific dollar amount at stake can file in small claims court. Both routes are inexpensive and don't require an attorney."

  example: {
    en: "A woman buys a jacket at a Rochester clothing store. She brings it back 10 days later, unworn with the tags on. The cashier says 'all sales final.' The woman looks around the store and at the register — there is no posted return policy. Under GBL 218-a, with no policy posted, she is entitled to a full refund within 20 days of purchase. She cites the law. When the store still refuses, she files a complaint with the NYS Attorney General."
