  summary: {
    en: "New York is an \"at-will\" state. That means your boss can fire you for almost any reason — or no reason at all. But there are some reasons that are against the law. Your boss cannot fire you because of who you are, because you reported something illegal, or because you used a right the law gives you. If they do, it may be wrongful firing."
  },

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Anyone in New York who was fired, laid off, or pushed out of a job for an illegal reason. Illegal reasons include discrimination, retaliation, and punishment for whistleblowing.",
      "Workers at businesses with 4 or more employees are covered by the New York State Human Rights Law. Some rules — like the ban on wage retaliation — apply no matter how small the business is.",
      "Workers who were forced to quit because the boss made things so bad that a normal person couldn't stay. The law calls this \"constructive discharge\" — it counts the same as being fired.",
      "Workers with an employment contract, a union contract, or an employee handbook that says they can only be fired for certain reasons."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Getting fired for no reason is legal in New York. Getting fired for an illegal reason is not. The main illegal reasons are:\n\n1) Discrimination — firing someone because of who they are.\n2) Retaliation — firing someone for reporting a problem or using a legal right.\n3) Whistleblowing — firing someone for reporting illegal activity or serious safety problems.\n\nNew York's Human Rights Law (Executive Law § 296) lists the groups protected from discrimination. That list is bigger than the federal list. It includes race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, and disability. It also covers religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, military status, arrest or conviction record, and being a domestic violence victim."

  yourRights: {
    en: [
      "You have the right not to be fired because of your race, sex, age, disability, religion, national origin, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, military status, arrest or conviction record, or status as a domestic violence victim (Executive Law § 296).",
      "You have the right not to be fired for reporting discrimination, harassment, wage theft, unsafe working conditions, or other illegal activity. That's called retaliation, and it is against the law (Executive Law § 296; Labor Law § 215).",
      "You have the right not to be fired for whistleblowing. Whistleblowing means reporting something you believe breaks a law or causes a serious danger to public health or safety (Labor Law § 740).",
      "You have the right not to be fired for using legal rights. These include family or medical leave, workers' comp claims, jury duty, voting, and military service.",
      "You have the right not to be fired for asking for a reasonable change at work because of a disability or pregnancy. Asking itself is protected (Reasonable Accommodation Anti-Retaliation Act, effective December 2025).",
      "If you win a case, the court can order things like: getting your old job back, missing pay, future pay you would have earned, money for the harm it caused, extra punishment money for bad behavior by the employer, and your lawyer's fees. The judge decides what fits your case."

      "You can file a discrimination or retaliation complaint with the New York State Division of Human Rights. You usually have 1 year from the firing to file. The Division investigates, holds hearings, and can order money damages. More at dhr.ny.gov.",

      "For whistleblower cases, you usually have 2 years to sue (Labor Law § 740). The court can order your job back plus pay and damages.",
      "For wage retaliation, you can file a complaint with the New York State Department of Labor. Call 1-888-469-7365. Labor Law § 215 lets the court order your job back, missing pay, and up to $10,000 extra.",

  example: {
    en: "David worked at a warehouse for three years. He hurt his back on the job and filed a workers' comp claim. Two weeks later, his boss fired him. The boss said the company was \"restructuring.\" David thought the real reason was his injury claim. He filed a retaliation complaint with the Division of Human Rights. The Division looked into it. There was no restructuring — David was the only person fired. The company was ordered to pay David back wages and damages."
