    en: "When a parent is ordered to pay child support and does not, the other parent has several ways to enforce the order. New York can take money from wages, tax refunds, bank accounts, and even suspend the non-paying parent's driver's license or passport."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Child support in New York is enforced by the local Support Collection Unit (SCU), which is part of the Department of Social Services. When a parent falls behind on payments, the SCU has powerful tools to collect. Income execution (wage garnishment) is the most common — the employer takes the child support directly from the paycheck before the parent sees it. The SCU can also intercept federal and state tax refunds, freeze bank accounts, suspend the non-paying parent's driver's license, report the debt to credit bureaus, and deny or revoke a passport for arrears over $2,500. If the parent still does not pay, the SCU can file a violation petition in Family Court. The court can hold the parent in contempt, which can result in up to six months in jail. The court can also require the parent to look for work and report back. A parent who is owed money can also file their own violation petition in Family Court without going through the SCU. This is sometimes faster than waiting for the SCU to act. Interstate enforcement is handled under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, which lets the SCU work with the other state's child support agency to collect from a parent who moved. Crossing state lines does not let the non-paying parent escape the obligation — every state has agreed to enforce other states' child support orders. For a parent who is unable to pay (rather than refusing to pay), the court has options short of jail. Income deeming, payment plans, and work-search orders can resolve cases where the parent wants to pay but cannot at the current rate. The court can also waive interest on arrears for indigent parents under FCT 451 in some cases. Birth fathers who are not on the birth certificate but provided support can establish paternity through the court if the mother contests the relationship; this matters when the father later seeks visitation rights or shared decision-making."

  example: {
    en: "Monique's ex-husband had not paid child support in eight months and owed $6,400. The SCU had set up wage garnishment, but he quit his job. Monique filed a violation petition in Family Court on her own. The judge found her ex in willful violation and ordered him to pay $500 per month toward the arrears on top of the regular support amount. The judge also suspended his driver's license until he showed proof of consistent payments. Within three months, he was back on track."
