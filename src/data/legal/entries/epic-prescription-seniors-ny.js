  summary: {
    en: "The Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage (EPIC) program helps New York residents aged 65 and older pay for prescription drugs. EPIC works with Medicare Part D to lower out-of-pocket costs. It is income-based, and many seniors who qualify do not know about it."

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Any New York resident aged 65 or older with income under $75,000 (single) or $100,000 (married).",
      "Any senior who has Medicare Part D and still struggles to afford prescriptions.",
      "Any senior who does not have Medicare Part D and needs help paying for medications.",
      "Any family member helping a senior apply for prescription assistance."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "EPIC is a New York State program run by the Department of Health. It has two plans based on income. The Fee Plan covers seniors with annual income up to $20,000 (single) or $26,000 (married) — they pay an annual fee ranging from $8 to $300 based on prior-year income, and then pay a copay of $3 to $20 per prescription. The Deductible Plan covers seniors with income from $20,001 to $75,000 (single) or $26,001 to $100,000 (married) — they pay full cost until they meet an annual deductible, then pay the same low copays. EPIC is designed to work alongside Medicare Part D. For Fee Plan members, EPIC pays the Medicare Part D monthly premium up to the average basic-plan cost (about $58.82/month in 2026). For Deductible Plan members above the $23,001 single / $29,001 married threshold, the member pays their own Part D premium and EPIC reduces their annual deductible by the approximate basic-plan annual cost (about $706 in 2026). For seniors who do not have Part D, EPIC covers prescriptions directly, but at higher cost — enrollment in Part D is strongly encouraged. EPIC covers most prescription drugs. Some over-the-counter medications are covered if prescribed by a doctor. EPIC does not cover drugs already fully covered by another program. The application is a one-page form. There is no asset test — only income matters. EPIC pairs particularly well with the federal Extra Help (Low-Income Subsidy) program for Medicare Part D, which provides additional copay reductions for seniors below specific income thresholds. The Medicare Savings Program is another related benefit that pays Medicare Part B premiums and sometimes Part D costs for low-income seniors; the three programs together can reduce a senior's healthcare costs to a small fraction of full price. Documentation needed for the EPIC application is minimal: proof of age, proof of NY residency, and proof of income (last year's tax return or recent benefit letter). The Lifespan and HIICAP (Health Insurance Information, Counseling, and Assistance Program) counselors at the Office for the Aging walk applicants through the form for free. Once enrolled, the EPIC card works at any participating pharmacy in NY, and most major chains and independents participate. A senior who travels seasonally to another state can use mail-order pharmacy options to keep prescriptions filled while away."

  example: {
    en: "Frank, 72, lives in Irondequoit on a fixed income of $28,000 a year. He takes four prescription medications that cost him over $300 a month out of pocket even with Medicare Part D. His daughter helped him apply for EPIC. He qualified for the Fee Plan with an annual fee of $8. His prescriptions now cost $3 to $7 each. His monthly drug costs dropped from $300 to about $20."
