  summary: {
    en: "Parma handles plumbing under the general building permit. There's no separate plumbing permit in Parma's town code. The Village of Hilton is inside Parma but has its own Building Department — which office handles your permit depends on which side of the village line your property sits."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Parma's Building Department handles plumbing under the general building permit process. The town follows the state Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code. Plumbing work that typically needs a permit includes water heater replacement, new fixtures, sewer laterals, and water service lines. The town code notes that \"listed portable\" plumbing appliances may not need a permit — check the exemption list.\n\nThe town has no separate plumber licensing chapter. Plumbers need liability insurance and workers comp. Whether Parma accepts a Rochester Examining Board plumber certificate is not published — call to confirm.\n\nA fee schedule PDF (effective January 1, 2023) is online but may have been updated — confirm current numbers before filing.\n\nIMPORTANT: The Village of Hilton is inside Parma but has its own Building Department. If your property is inside the village limits, you use the Hilton village Building Department, not Parma."

  example: {
    en: "A plumber in Parma (outside Hilton village) needs to run new drain lines for a kitchen remodel. She files a building permit with Parma. Across the street in Hilton village, her colleague is doing similar work — but for that address, the permit goes to the Hilton village Building Department, not Parma."
