  title: { en: "COBRA Health Insurance — Keeping Coverage After a Job Loss" },

  summary: {
    en: "When a job ends, COBRA allows a worker and their family to keep the employer's health plan for up to 18 months (sometimes 36). The worker pays the full premium plus a 2 percent administrative fee. For many families the marketplace (NY State of Health) is cheaper. Understanding both options before picking one prevents expensive mistakes."
  },

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Any worker who lost a job (except firing for gross misconduct) at an employer with 20 or more employees.",
      "Any spouse or dependent child who was on the employer's plan and lost coverage due to job loss, divorce, death of the worker, or aging out.",
      "Any worker at a small employer (under 20 employees) who lost coverage — New York's mini-COBRA (Insurance Law Section 3221(m)) extends similar rights.",
      "Any worker whose hours were cut below the plan's eligibility threshold."
    ]

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "The federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA, 29 USC Sections 1161-1168) lets a person keep the employer's group health plan after a qualifying event. The worker pays the premium that the employer previously paid plus the worker's share, plus up to a 2 percent administrative fee — often several hundred to over a thousand dollars per month for family coverage. The maximum period is 18 months for job loss or reduced hours, 36 months for divorce, death of the worker, or a dependent child aging out. The employer must send a COBRA election notice within 14 days of the qualifying event. The worker has 60 days to decide whether to elect COBRA. An election can be retroactive — if elected within the 60-day window, coverage picks up without a gap. Payments are due monthly. Missing a payment by more than 30 days ends the coverage. For most people, NY State of Health marketplace plans are cheaper than COBRA — with income-based subsidies available. The Essential Plan costs $0-$20/month for people who qualify. A job loss is a qualifying event for special enrollment on the marketplace, and the 60-day COBRA window does not prevent using the marketplace. Choosing the marketplace means giving up any employer subsidy, but the family saves if their income is modest. Small-employer workers in New York (under 20 employees) have similar rights under state mini-COBRA — same 18-to-36-month rules but administered through the insurance carrier rather than the employer. The American Rescue Plan COBRA subsidy that covered premiums in 2021 has expired and is not currently available, but other premium-assistance programs may help. Health Insurance Premium Payment programs through Medicaid can sometimes pay COBRA premiums when continuing employer coverage is more cost-effective than putting the family on Medicaid; the Monroe County DSS can run that calculation. Coverage gaps to watch: prescription drug formularies and provider networks can change between an employer plan and a marketplace plan, even when the same insurer's name appears on both. Switching mid-treatment for a chronic condition or ongoing therapy can disrupt care if a key provider is out-of-network on the new plan. Open enrollment, generally each November through January for marketplace plans, gives a yearly chance to switch; outside that window, only a qualifying life event triggers special enrollment. Job loss, marriage, divorce, birth of a child, and loss of other coverage all qualify."

  example: {
    en: "After being laid off from her job in Henrietta, Keisha received a COBRA notice saying she could keep her family's health plan for $1,650 a month. She had 60 days to decide. She went to nystateofhealth.ny.gov and entered her expected income. The system showed she qualified for a Silver-tier plan with subsidies at $240 a month — with the same pediatrician in-network for her children. She skipped COBRA and enrolled in the marketplace plan. She saved over $1,400 a month."
