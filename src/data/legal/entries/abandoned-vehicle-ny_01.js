  summary: {
    en: "An abandoned vehicle on private property or a public street can be reported for removal. In New York, a vehicle is considered abandoned if it has been left unattended on public property for more than 96 hours, or on private property without the owner's consent. The process for removal depends on whether the vehicle is on public or private property and whether the owner can be identified. Vehicle owners who abandon a car can face fines."

    en: [
      "Any property owner who has an abandoned vehicle on their land.",
      "Any resident who wants to report an abandoned vehicle on a public street.",
      "Any person who purchased property and found vehicles left behind by the prior owner.",
      "Any person whose own vehicle was towed as abandoned and wants to reclaim it."
    ]
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Under Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1224, a vehicle left unattended on a public highway or public property for more than 96 consecutive hours is considered abandoned. The police or municipality can have it towed and stored. The owner is notified by mail (if the owner can be identified through the registration). If the owner does not claim the vehicle within a specified period, the vehicle can be sold at auction or scrapped. For vehicles on private property: the property owner can have the vehicle removed, but must follow the process — typically contacting the police or the local code enforcement office, which will attempt to identify the owner and issue a notice. The property owner generally cannot sell or scrap the vehicle themselves — they must go through the legal process, which may include obtaining a court order or a DMV abandoned vehicle title. In Rochester, abandoned vehicles on public streets can be reported through 311. The city will investigate, tag the vehicle, and have it towed if it meets the criteria. For vehicles on private property, the property owner contacts the police non-emergency line."
