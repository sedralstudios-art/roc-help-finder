  summary: {
    en: "A Medicaid recipient age 21 or older who needs community-based long-term care for more than 120 days is usually required to enroll in a Managed Long-Term Care plan. MLTC plans coordinate home care, adult day health, nursing home care, personal care, and related services. The enrollment broker is NY Medicaid Choice. Plan selection matters — not every plan covers the same home care agencies or services."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "MLTC is a Medicaid program through which most New York adults needing ongoing long-term care receive services through a private health plan contracted with the state, rather than through traditional fee-for-service Medicaid. The required enrollment population includes adults 21+ who need more than 120 days of community-based long-term care services (home care, adult day care, medical supplies and equipment, transportation to medical appointments) and dual eligibles meeting similar criteria. The MLTC plan receives a monthly capitation payment from Medicaid and is responsible for arranging the enrollee's covered services. Three plan types: (1) Partial Capitation MLTC covers only long-term care services — the enrollee keeps fee-for-service Medicare and Medicaid for medical care; (2) Medicaid Advantage Plus (MAP) combines Medicare Advantage and Medicaid long-term care in one plan; (3) Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) integrates all care for enrollees 55+ who qualify for nursing home placement. Enrollment process: the local Department of Social Services refers the person to NY Medicaid Choice (the state enrollment broker) at 1-888-401-6582. An independent assessor (currently the Conflict-Free Evaluation and Enrollment Center, CFEEC) conducts an initial assessment of daily living needs. If the person qualifies, they select a plan from those operating in Monroe County. Each plan publishes a provider network — which home care agencies it contracts with, which nursing homes accept its members. The enrollee has the right to change plans during open enrollment (annually) and has a 90-day plan-switch right at the start of enrollment. Continuity of care: when switching plans, the new plan must continue the existing hours and aides for a transition period (typically 90 days for personal care). Fair hearings: an enrollee can request a Medicaid fair hearing for any denial, reduction, or termination of services. The fair hearing is free and decisions can reinstate services with retroactive coverage. Aid continuing: if the fair hearing is requested within 10 days of a reduction notice, services must continue at the pre-reduction level while the hearing is pending."

  example: {
    en: "A Rochester Medicaid recipient turning 70 began needing help with bathing and medication management at home. Her daughter contacted Monroe County DSS, which referred her to NY Medicaid Choice. The CFEEC assessor determined she needed 28 hours per week of personal care. The daughter compared three MLTC plans operating in Monroe County — one had the home care agency her mother already knew, another had lower out-of-network costs. She chose the first. During the first week, the plan authorized only 20 hours. The family contacted ICAN, which filed a fair hearing request within 10 days, triggering aid continuing at 28 hours. The hearing reinstated the full authorization and recouped the shortfall."
