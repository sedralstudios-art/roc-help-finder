  summary: {
    en: "In New York, every registered vehicle must have continuous insurance coverage. If insurance lapses — even for one day — the DMV will suspend the vehicle's registration and may suspend the owner's driver's license. Reinstating registration after a lapse requires proof of new insurance and payment of a civil penalty. The penalties increase with the length of the lapse."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Under New York Vehicle and Traffic Law Section 318, the insurance company must notify the DMV whenever a policy is cancelled or lapses. The DMV then sends a notice to the vehicle owner demanding proof of insurance within a set period. If the owner does not provide proof, the DMV suspends the vehicle registration. If the vehicle is driven with a suspended registration, the driver faces a traffic ticket, a fine, and possible impoundment of the vehicle. The civil penalty for a lapse is set by the DMV on a per-day schedule that increases the longer the lapse runs. The shortest lapses carry the smallest daily charge; longer lapses carry a higher daily rate. The current per-day amounts and the maximum lapse window before the DMV stops accepting a civil-penalty payment in lieu of a license suspension are published by the DMV at dmv.ny.gov/insurance/insurance-lapse-702. The numbers move from time to time, so the DMV page is the right place to confirm the current schedule. The civil penalty adds up fast — a lapse of even a few weeks can run into the hundreds of dollars. In addition to the civil penalty, the DMV can suspend the owner's driver's license for an uninsured vehicle under VTL Section 319. Reinstating the registration requires providing proof of new insurance — the new insurer files an FS-1 form electronically with the DMV — and paying the civil penalty owed for the lapse period. The DMV may also charge a separate reinstatement fee; the current fee is on the DMV reinstatement page. When switching insurance carriers, there must be no gap between the old policy end date and the new policy start date. Even a one-day gap triggers the DMV lapse process. SR-22 filings — required in some states for high-risk drivers — are not part of the New York system. NY has no SR-22 requirement; instead, the DMV enforces continuous-coverage compliance through the FS-1 verification system tied to every registered vehicle. A driver who moves to NY from a state with an SR-22 obligation does not need to maintain that filing once registered in NY, but the underlying high-risk classification can carry over and affect premiums. Out-of-state insurance does not satisfy the NY requirement once the vehicle is registered in NY; the policy must be issued or accepted in New York. Some carriers offer comprehensive-only coverage when a vehicle will not be driven for an extended period — that keeps the policy continuous (no lapse) while reducing the premium. The plates do not have to be surrendered if a comprehensive-only policy stays in force."

  example: {
    en: "When switching car insurance carriers, Darnell's old policy ended on March 15 and his new policy started on March 17 — a 2-day gap. The old insurer notified the DMV of the cancellation. The DMV sent Darnell a lapse notice and suspended his registration. Darnell had to have his new insurer file an FS-1 form, pay the civil penalty for the 2 days the vehicle was uninsured, and pay any reinstatement fee the DMV charged. The civil penalty for a short lapse is small but the time and paperwork to reinstate is the bigger hassle. If Darnell had started the new policy on March 15, none of this would have happened."
