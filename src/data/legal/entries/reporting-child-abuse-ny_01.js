  summary: {
    en: "If a child is being abused or neglected, anyone can report it to the New York Statewide Central Register (SCR) at any time. Certain professionals — teachers, doctors, social workers, police — are legally required to report (mandated reporters). Reports can also be made anonymously by anyone. The report triggers an investigation by Child Protective Services."

      "Anyone who suspects a child is being abused or neglected can make a report. There is no requirement to be certain — a reasonable suspicion is enough.",
      "Mandated reporters (teachers, school staff, doctors, nurses, social workers, police, day care workers, and others listed in Social Services Law § 413) are legally required to report. Failure to report is a misdemeanor.",
      "Reports can be made about any child under 18 in New York."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "When a report is made to the SCR hotline, it is transmitted to the local Child Protective Services (CPS) office — in Monroe County, that is the Monroe County Department of Human Services. CPS must begin an investigation within 24 hours for reports alleging abuse and within 24 hours for neglect reports. The investigation includes visiting the home, interviewing the child, and assessing safety. If the child is in immediate danger, CPS can remove the child from the home under Family Court Act § 1024 (emergency removal) and must bring the case to Family Court within 24-72 hours. The investigation results in one of three findings: indicated (evidence supports the allegation), unsubstantiated (not enough evidence), or unfounded (no credible evidence). An indicated finding goes on the SCR registry. The parent has the right to request a fair hearing to challenge an indicated finding. Reporters acting in good faith are immune from civil and criminal liability under Social Services Law § 419."

  example: {
    en: "A teacher in an RCSD school notices a student frequently coming to class with unexplained bruises and appearing fearful. As a mandated reporter, the teacher calls the SCR hotline at 1-800-342-3720 and provides the child's name, school, and observations. Monroe County CPS begins an investigation within 24 hours. A caseworker visits the home and interviews the child in a safe setting. Services are offered to the family, and the child's safety is monitored."
