  summary: {
    en: "If the Department of Social Services says you received more benefits than you were entitled to, they may try to collect the difference. This can happen even if the overpayment was the agency's mistake. You have the right to appeal, to request a hardship reduction, and to negotiate a repayment plan."

  whoQualifies: {
    en: [
      "Anyone who receives a notice saying they were overpaid SNAP, Temporary Assistance, Medicaid, or other public benefits.",
      "Anyone whose benefits are being reduced to repay an overpayment (called recoupment).",
      "Anyone who receives a notice demanding repayment of benefits after their case was closed.",
      "Anyone who received aid continuing during a fair hearing and then received an unfavorable decision."
    ]
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "An overpayment happens when the agency determines you received more benefits than you should have. This can happen because of an agency error or a change in your circumstances that was not reported in time. It can also happen because benefits continued during a fair hearing that you lost. The agency must send you a written notice explaining the overpayment amount and the reason. If you have an active case, the agency may reduce your current benefits to collect the overpayment. This is called recoupment. For Temporary Assistance, recoupment is limited to 10% of your monthly grant. You can request a reduction to 5% if repaying at 10% causes undue hardship. For SNAP, recoupment is taken from your monthly SNAP benefit. If your case is closed, the agency may ask you to set up a repayment plan. For SNAP overpayments that are not repaid, the federal government may collect the amount from your federal tax refund. This is done through the Treasury Offset Program. You have the right to appeal any overpayment determination through a fair hearing."

  example: {
    en: "Renee receives Temporary Assistance in Monroe County. She got a notice saying she had been overpaid $600 because she started a part-time job and did not report the income within 10 days. Her monthly grant was reduced by 10% to repay the amount. Renee called Legal Aid and learned she could request a hardship reduction. She submitted a written request to DSS with proof that her expenses exceeded her income. DSS agreed to reduce the recoupment to 5% of her grant. The lower amount was easier for her to manage while she continued working."
