  summary: {
    en: "Clarkson has a separate plumbing permit with a published fee: $65 flat plus $2 per fixture for residential work. Fees double if work starts without a permit. The town doesn't have its own plumber licensing — plumbers must carry liability insurance and workers comp."
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Clarkson requires a separate plumbing permit (not bundled with the building permit). The fee is $65 plus $2 per fixture for residential. Commercial is $100 plus $10 per fixture.\n\nIf you start plumbing work without a permit, the fee doubles. A new sewer hookup is a separate cost: $125 to the town plus a $250 county fee.\n\nThe town does not have its own plumber licensing chapter. Plumbers have to show liability insurance and workers comp (or a CE-200 waiver for sole proprietors). Whether the town honors a Rochester Examining Board certificate is not published — call to confirm.\n\nHomeowner self-work rules for plumbing are not spelled out on the town's public fee schedule. Call the Building Department at (585) 637-1145 to confirm before doing your own work."

  example: {
    en: "A plumber in Clarkson does a bathroom remodel with 5 new fixtures. The plumbing permit fee is $65 + ($2 × 5) = $75 total, plus workers comp and insurance proof. If the plumber had started work first, the fee would have doubled to $150. The town building inspector does the rough-in and final inspections."
