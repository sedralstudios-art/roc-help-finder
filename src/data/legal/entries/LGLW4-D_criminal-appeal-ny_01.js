  summary: {
    en: "If you are convicted of a crime, you generally have the right to appeal. An appeal asks a higher court to review the trial court's decision for legal errors. In New York, the deadline to file a Notice of Appeal is 30 days after sentencing. Free appellate counsel is available for people who cannot afford a private lawyer."

    en: [
      "Anyone convicted after a trial or, in some cases, after a guilty plea.",
      "The appeal must be filed within 30 days of sentencing — this is a hard deadline.",
      "If you waived your right to appeal as part of a plea agreement, the scope of the appeal may be limited but certain issues (like an illegal sentence) can still be raised."
    ]
  },

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "An appeal is not a new trial. A higher court (the Appellate Division) reviews the written record from the trial court — transcripts, motions, evidence — and decides whether the trial judge made a legal error serious enough to change the outcome. Common grounds for appeal include: the judge admitted evidence that should have been excluded, the jury instructions were wrong, the sentence was illegal or excessively harsh, or the defense lawyer was so ineffective that the defendant did not get a fair trial. The appellate court can affirm the conviction (uphold it), reverse it (throw it out), modify the sentence, or order a new trial. The process takes months to years. Filing the Notice of Appeal within 30 days is critical — missing the deadline usually means the right is lost. After the notice is filed, the appellate court assigns a lawyer if you cannot afford one. The lawyer reviews the record, identifies issues, and writes a brief arguing why the conviction or sentence should be overturned."

  example: {
    en: "After a trial, Jaylen is convicted of a felony and sentenced to prison. His trial lawyer tells him he has 30 days to file a Notice of Appeal. Jaylen files the notice at the county clerk's office the following week. The Appellate Division assigns him an appellate attorney, who reviews the trial record and finds that the judge gave an incorrect instruction to the jury on a key element of the charge. The appellate attorney writes a brief arguing this was reversible error. The Appellate Division agrees and orders a new trial."
