  summary: {
    en: "In New York, most debts have a statute of limitations — a deadline after which the creditor can no longer sue to collect. Under the Consumer Credit Fairness Act, the deadline for consumer credit debt (credit cards, store cards, personal loans) is 3 years. After that, the debt is time-barred. A debt collector can still call and send letters, but cannot file a lawsuit. If a collector sues on a time-barred debt, the debtor has a complete defense."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "New York has more than one statute of limitations for debt depending on the kind of debt. Under CPLR Section 213, written contracts traditionally carried a 6-year limit, and that 6-year window still applies to many ordinary breach-of-contract claims. But in 2021 the Consumer Credit Fairness Act added CPLR Section 214-i, which sets a shorter 3-year limit for actions on a consumer credit transaction — credit cards, store cards, and other consumer credit. The clock generally starts from the default date and does not restart even if the debt is sold to a debt buyer or charged off and re-aged. After the limitations period runs, the debt is time-barred. The creditor or collector cannot sue to collect it. If they do file a lawsuit, the debtor can raise the statute of limitations as a complete defense and the case will be dismissed. Important: the debt still exists after the statute expires — it just cannot be enforced through a lawsuit. A collector can still call, send letters, and ask for payment, subject to other federal and state limits on how often and how. A dangerous trap exists in many states: making a partial payment on a time-barred debt can restart the statute of limitations. New York closed that trap for consumer credit. Under CPLR 214-i, a partial payment, oral acknowledgment, or other voluntary act by the debtor does not revive the limitations period for a consumer credit transaction. Old debts are often sold to debt buyers for pennies on the dollar. These buyers aggressively pursue collection, sometimes filing lawsuits on debts they know are time-barred, hoping the debtor will not show up to court. If the debtor does not appear, the collector can get a default judgment — even on a time-barred debt — and that judgment can then be enforced through wage garnishment or bank levies. Recent rules have tightened restrictions on suing on time-barred debt. The CFPB's 2021 Regulation F prohibits a debt collector from filing or threatening to file a lawsuit on a debt the collector knows or should know is time-barred. The Consumer Credit Fairness Act also requires plaintiffs in New York consumer credit lawsuits to attach specific documentation — the original creditor's account information, an itemized statement of the debt, and a chain of assignments if the debt was sold — before the court will enter a default judgment. The reforms came after the NY Department of Financial Services found that debt buyers were obtaining hundreds of thousands of default judgments every year on stale debts, simply by suing debtors who did not respond."

  example: {
    en: "A debt collector contacted Rosa about an old credit card debt. Rosa had not made a payment in more than 4 years. Because the 3-year limit in CPLR 214-i had run, the debt was time-barred — no lawsuit could be filed on it. The collector offered to settle for a fraction of the balance. Rosa sent a written letter telling the collector the debt was past the statute of limitations and to stop contacting her. The collector stopped. If the collector had sued anyway, Rosa could have raised the statute of limitations as a defense and the case would have been dismissed."
