  title: { en: "Credit Freeze — Free Way to Block Identity Thieves From Opening Accounts" },

  summary: {
    en: "A credit freeze locks the credit report so no lender can pull it to approve new credit. Identity thieves cannot open a credit card, loan, or phone account in the frozen person's name. Federal law requires Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion to provide freezes at no cost. The freeze can be lifted temporarily (for a mortgage application, for example) and refrozen. A fraud alert is a weaker alternative that does not block access but requires extra verification."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "A credit freeze — also called a security freeze — blocks lenders from pulling the credit report. Without access to the report, lenders almost always deny new applications. Identity thieves cannot open credit cards, auto loans, mortgages, or utility accounts in the frozen person's name. Under the federal Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (2018), amending the Fair Credit Reporting Act at 15 USC Section 1681c-1, freezes are free at all three major bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion). Full protection requires a separate freeze at each of the three bureaus — they do not share data. Placing a freeze takes about 15 minutes total: visit each bureau's website, verify identity, set a PIN or password, and the freeze goes into effect within one business day. Removing a freeze temporarily (called a 'thaw' or 'lift') is also free and can be done for a specific time period or for a specific lender. The freeze does not affect the credit score or existing accounts — existing creditors still report, the person can still use existing credit cards. A fraud alert is different: it stays on the file for one year and requires lenders to take extra steps to verify identity, but does not block access. Seven-year extended fraud alerts are available after filing a police report. Children under 16 can also have a freeze through the bureaus. A frozen account holder can still pull their own credit report for free at annualcreditreport.com. Two smaller credit reporting agencies — Innovis and ChexSystems — are sometimes used by lenders and by banks for new account screening. Freezing at all five (the big three plus Innovis and ChexSystems) provides the most complete protection. Credit freezes do not affect employment background checks, insurance underwriting that uses credit-based insurance scores, or pre-existing creditor account reviews. Some employers and insurers use specialty consumer reports rather than the standard credit report; freezes do not necessarily extend to specialty reports. Identity theft recovery typically takes weeks to months even after the freeze is in place, because cleaning fraudulent accounts off the credit reports requires written disputes with each bureau and each lender. Filing a police report and an FTC identity theft report at identitytheft.gov produces an Identity Theft Report that creditors are required to honor when removing fraudulent debts."

  example: {
    en: "After receiving a data breach notice from a health system, a Rochester resident placed a credit freeze at all three bureaus. The process took about 15 minutes online. Six months later, an identity thief tried to open a credit card in his name. The card issuer could not pull the credit report because of the freeze and denied the application. The attempt was automatically flagged in the credit report. He did nothing extra — the freeze worked silently. When he later applied for a mortgage, he temporarily lifted the freeze at each bureau for the specific lender, the lender pulled the report and approved the loan, and he refroze afterward. The whole sequence cost him nothing."
