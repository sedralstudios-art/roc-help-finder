  whatItMeans: {
    en: "New York Insurance Law Article 49, specifically Section 4914, establishes the NY External Appeal Program. When a NY-regulated health insurance plan denies coverage, the member has the right to an independent external review by a state-assigned Independent Review Organization (IRO) not connected to the plan. The IRO's decision is binding on the insurer. External appeal is available for specific types of denials. MEDICAL NECESSITY denials — the plan says the treatment is not medically necessary. EXPERIMENTAL OR INVESTIGATIONAL denials — the plan says the treatment is experimental and not covered. OUT-OF-NETWORK REFERRAL denials — the plan denied a referral to a specialist outside the network when the patient argues no in-network provider is available for the medical need. OUT-OF-NETWORK RATE denials — the plan paid less than billed charges for out-of-network care and the patient disputes the calculation. OUT-OF-NETWORK AUTHORIZATION — similar disputes about out-of-network services. HEALTHCARE-RELATED EMERGENCY TRANSPORT — ambulance coverage disputes. Not covered by external appeal: denials for eligibility (not a member, premium unpaid, not a covered condition category), cost-sharing disputes (copay or deductible questions), administrative errors (billed wrong amount, coding errors that are not clinical), and denials by ERISA self-funded plans (those have separate federal appeal mechanisms). PROCESS: (1) Complete the plan's internal appeal first. The plan must tell the member the final adverse determination in writing. (2) File external appeal with the NY Department of Financial Services within 4 months of the final adverse determination. Form DFS EAPP-1 is available online at dfs.ny.gov or by mail. (3) Pay the 25 dollar filing fee. Waived for financial hardship. (4) The member or the member's doctor provides supporting medical records, relevant clinical evidence, and a statement of why the denied treatment is appropriate. (5) DFS assigns the case to a certified IRO. The IRO is staffed by clinicians with expertise in the relevant medical specialty. (6) The IRO reviews the records and either agrees with the insurer or overturns the denial. Decision is typically issued within 30 days for standard appeals, 72 hours for expedited (urgent medical need), or 72 hours for experimental/investigational treatment for terminal conditions. (7) The decision is binding on the insurer. If the IRO overturns the denial, the insurer must cover the treatment. If the IRO agrees with the insurer, the member can still sue in court but only if ERISA preemption or another legal basis allows. PATIENT SUCCESS RATES: NY DFS publishes annual statistics. Historically about 40 to 50 percent of external appeals result in full or partial overturn of the denial. Specialty-specific rates vary — cancer treatment denials and behavioral health denials are often overturned above 60 percent. PREPARATION TIPS: The strongest appeals include (1) letters from treating physicians explaining medical necessity, (2) peer-reviewed journal articles supporting the treatment, (3) specialty society guidelines endorsing the treatment, (4) evidence of failed alternative treatments, (5) second opinions confirming the treatment decision. The NY Attorney General Health Care Bureau and the Community Service Society of NY Health Helpline at 1-888-614-5400 provide free help preparing external appeals. Legal Aid Society of Rochester also handles cases for low-income appellants. EXPEDITED APPEALS: For urgent or emergency medical needs, expedited external appeal is available with 72-hour decision. The appeal form is marked expedited, the patient's physician certifies urgent need, and the IRO is assigned same-day. SELF-FUNDED ERISA PLANS: Employees of self-insured employer plans (large companies that act as their own insurance company) do not have NY external appeal rights under state law. However, the federal Affordable Care Act at 29 USC 1185e requires self-funded plans to offer external appeal through a federally-approved IRO, which is similar in effect. The ACA external appeal is filed with the plan's designated IRO. SPECIAL RULES: Medicaid appeals go through the NY Fair Hearing process rather than external appeal. Medicare appeals have their own federal process. Essential Plan and Child Health Plus appeals go through NY State of Health."

  example: {
    en: "Omar's health insurer denied an advanced MRI scan his oncologist had ordered for suspected cancer spread. The plan said standard imaging was sufficient. Omar's oncologist wrote a detailed letter explaining the specific clinical reasons advanced imaging was medically necessary, with supporting journal references. Omar completed the plan's internal appeal; the plan denied again. Within 4 months Omar filed NY external appeal with Form DFS EAPP-1, paid the 25 dollar fee, and requested expedited review citing cancer urgency. An oncology-specialty IRO reviewed the file and overturned the denial within 6 days. The insurer paid for the advanced MRI."
