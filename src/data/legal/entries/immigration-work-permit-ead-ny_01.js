  summary: {
    en: "An Employment Authorization Document (EAD) is a card issued by USCIS that allows certain non-citizens to work legally in the United States. Many people are eligible but do not know it. The application process, wait times, and rules depend on the person's immigration status."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "An EAD (Employment Authorization Document) is a work permit card issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). It allows the holder to work for any employer in the United States. The card is typically valid for one or two years and must be renewed before it expires. Different immigration categories have different paths to an EAD. Asylum applicants can apply 150 days after filing their case if no decision has been made. TPS holders apply as part of their TPS registration. DACA recipients apply with their DACA renewal. People with pending green card applications can apply while waiting. The application is Form I-765, filed with USCIS. Filing fees vary — some categories qualify for a fee waiver. Processing times can be long, sometimes six months or more. An expired EAD means the person cannot legally work until the new one arrives, though some categories have automatic extensions while the renewal is pending. Working without a valid EAD can have serious immigration consequences."

      "An employer cannot refuse to accept a valid EAD as proof of work authorization.",
      "An employer cannot demand specific documents — any combination of acceptable documents from the I-9 list is valid.",
      "Certain EAD categories receive automatic 180-day extensions when a timely renewal is filed.",
      "A person has the right to request expedited processing from USCIS if they face severe financial loss.",
      "A person has the right to file a complaint with the Department of Justice if an employer discriminates based on immigration status or EAD category."

      "USCIS processing times can be checked at egov.uscis.gov/processing-times. Current wait times for EADs vary widely.",
      "If the EAD is taking too long, the applicant can contact the USCIS Contact Center at (800) 375-5283 or file an inquiry (e-Request) online.",

  example: {
    en: "Maria applied for asylum after fleeing violence in her home country. After 150 days with no decision on her asylum case, she was eligible to apply for an EAD. She filed Form I-765 with a fee waiver. Seven months later, she received her EAD card and was able to work legally. When the card was about to expire, she filed a renewal. Because she filed on time, she received an automatic 180-day extension that allowed her to keep working while waiting for the new card."
