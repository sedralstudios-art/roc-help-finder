  summary: {
    en: "When you receive a traffic ticket in New York outside of NYC, it goes to a local town, village, or city court — not the DMV's Traffic Violations Bureau. This matters because outside NYC, plea bargaining is available. Many tickets can be negotiated down to a lower offense with fewer points. Ignoring the ticket leads to a license suspension and a possible warrant."

      "Anyone who received a traffic ticket (moving violation, parking violation, or equipment violation) anywhere in New York outside of New York City.",
      "Anyone who received a ticket in Monroe County — including Rochester, all towns, and all villages.",
      "NYC tickets go to the Traffic Violations Bureau (TVB), where plea bargaining is NOT available. This entry covers non-NYC courts only."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "A traffic ticket is an accusatory instrument — it charges you with a violation or, in some cases, a misdemeanor. When you receive one, the ticket tells you the court, the charge, and the date you must respond by. Three main options exist. First: plead guilty by mail or online and pay the fine plus surcharge. This is the fastest but results in full points on your license and may raise insurance rates. Second: plead not guilty and request a court date. At court, the prosecutor may offer a plea bargain — a reduction to a lower charge with fewer points or no points. This is the most common path and often the best outcome. Third: plead not guilty and go to trial. The officer must appear and testify. If they do not, the ticket may be dismissed. If you do nothing — no plea, no appearance — the court notifies the DMV and your license is suspended for failure to appear. A bench warrant may also be issued."

      "Outside NYC, plea bargaining with the prosecutor is available in most courts.",
      "A not-guilty plea preserves the right to negotiate or go to trial.",
      "The officer must appear and testify at trial — if absent, the ticket may be dismissed.",
      "Points from a conviction stay on the license for 18 months for insurance purposes.",
      "A defensive driving course (PIRP) can reduce up to 4 points and lower insurance by 10% for 3 years.",
      "If the ticket is a misdemeanor (reckless driving, AUO), the right to a lawyer applies — including a free one if you cannot afford it."

      "The court, date, and plea instructions are on the ticket. Responding before the deadline is critical — failure to respond leads to license suspension.",
      "In Rochester City Court, traffic cases are handled at the Hall of Justice, 99 Exchange Blvd. Phone: (585) 428-2444.",
      "For town and village courts in Monroe County, the court address and phone number are on the ticket. Court hours vary — many hold sessions only one or two evenings per month.",
      "A traffic lawyer is not required but can be helpful for serious tickets (speeding 20+ over, reckless driving, AUO). Some lawyers handle traffic tickets for a flat fee.",
      "The PIRP defensive driving course can be taken online or in person. It does not remove the conviction but reduces the point impact. Cost is approximately $25-$50 (subject to change — verify at dmv.ny.gov/tickets/point-insurance-reduction-program)."

  example: {
    en: "A driver gets a speeding ticket for 20 mph over the limit on Route 104 in Webster. The ticket carries 6 points. He pleads not guilty by mail and receives a court date. At court, the prosecutor offers a reduction to a 1-10 mph over charge (3 points) with a surcharge. The driver accepts the plea. He also takes the PIRP course online to reduce the point impact to 0 visible points and get a 10% insurance discount for 3 years."
