  summary: {
    en: "A lease can prohibit pets entirely or restrict size, breed, and number. But under New York Multiple Dwelling Law Section 27-2009.1 (NYC) and similar local rules, a landlord who knowingly tolerates a pet for three months waives the right to evict over that pet. Pet fees and pet deposits beyond standard rent and security are generally allowed in market-rate housing. Emotional support animals and service animals are separate — no-pets policies do not apply."

  whatItMeans: {
    en: "Pet ownership in rental housing is primarily governed by the lease. A lease that prohibits pets is generally enforceable — a tenant who brings in a pet in violation can face a cure notice and eventually eviction. A lease that allows pets can set limits: size caps, breed restrictions, number of animals, pet rent, pet deposits, pet insurance requirements, and rules about areas where pets are allowed in the building. For buildings with three or more units in New York City, Multiple Dwelling Law Section 27-2009.1 (the Pet Law) provides that a landlord who has knowledge of the pet for three months and does not start a proceeding to remove it waives the right to enforce a no-pets clause for that pet. Outside NYC, the three-month waiver rule does not apply by statute, but landlords who knowingly accept rent for months with a pet present may be found to have waived the clause under common-law principles. Pet fees: a non-refundable pet fee is typically allowed. Pet rent (monthly surcharge) is allowed. Pet deposits are tricky — under General Obligations Law Section 7-108, security deposits on most leases are capped at one month's rent, and some interpretations include pet deposits in that cap. Breed restrictions: blanket bans on specific breeds (pit bulls, Rottweilers, etc.) are legal for private landlords absent a fair housing accommodation. Service animals (covered by ADA for public places, FHA for housing) and emotional support animals (covered by FHA for housing) are not pets — see the separate service-animal and emotional-support-animal entries. A tenant whose ESA is refused because of breed restriction has a Fair Housing Act claim."

  example: {
    en: "A tenant in a 40-unit Rochester building had a small dog that the building superintendent saw regularly for six months while collecting rent. The lease had a no-pets clause. The building changed management and the new company served a cure notice demanding the dog be removed. Although the three-month Pet Law applies specifically to NYC, the tenant's attorney argued common-law waiver in the Monroe County court — the prior management's repeated acceptance of rent with knowledge of the dog constituted waiver. The judge agreed and dismissed the eviction proceeding."
