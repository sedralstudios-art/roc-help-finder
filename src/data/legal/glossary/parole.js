  context: {
    en: "You hear this about people finishing a prison sentence. Parole is the state's supervision when someone is let out of prison before the full sentence is over, or when supervision continues after a prison sentence is finished. It is handled by the state — not by the local probation office."
  },

  plainEnglish: {
    en: "Being released from state prison under supervision. A parole officer checks in with the person, and the person follows rules set by the Parole Board — like living at an approved address, reporting in, holding a job, staying away from certain people or places, and no new arrests. Breaking the rules can send the person back to prison. Parole is state-run, not county-run, and different from probation, which usually happens instead of prison. A New York law change means lawful cannabis use cannot be used to violate parole."
