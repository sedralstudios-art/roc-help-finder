  context: {
    en: "You hear this at arraignment. The judge may offer it instead of bail. It means the judge trusts you to come back to court without paying or posting anything."
  },

  plainEnglish: {
    en: "The judge lets you go home on a promise — no money. You just have to come to every court date. If you miss one, the judge can put a warrant out for your arrest, and next time you may be held instead of released. ROR is the most common way people leave arraignment in New York for small charges."
