  context: {
    en: "This comes up when a driver's license or registration is suspended — usually for driving without insurance, a DWI, or too many points. The DMV requires the driver to have their insurance company file an SR-22 before the license or registration can be restored."
  },

  plainEnglish: {
    en: "An SR-22 is a form an insurance company files with the DMV proving the driver has the required auto insurance. It is not a special type of insurance — it is just proof of a policy. The DMV requires it after certain violations — driving without insurance, a DWI, or an uninsured accident. The insurance company files it electronically. The driver has to keep the SR-22 on file for 3 years. If the insurance lapses during that time, the company notifies the DMV and the license or registration gets suspended again. An SR-22 requirement usually makes insurance more expensive."
