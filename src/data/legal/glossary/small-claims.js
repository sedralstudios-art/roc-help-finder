  context: {
    en: "You hear this when someone owes money and the amount is below a certain limit. Small claims is designed for people to handle themselves without a lawyer. Security deposit cases, unpaid loans to friends, and minor damage claims often end up here."

  plainEnglish: {
    en: "A part of the local court that handles smaller money disputes — up to $10,000 inside New York City, up to $5,000 everywhere else in New York. Filing fees are low (around $15 to $20). The process is simpler than regular court — less paperwork, no formal rules of evidence, usually one short hearing. Lawyers are not required, and most people do not bring one. You can file it yourself at the clerk's window of the city court, town court, or village justice court where the other party lives or works. If you win, you get a judgment — collecting on it is a separate step."
