  plainEnglish: {
    en: "When a case is sealed, most people — including future employers and landlords — cannot see that it ever happened. Police and some government agencies can still see it for a few reasons (like a new case or a gun license). New York seals the record on its own when a case ends in your favor: dismissed, found not guilty, ACD finished clean, or charges dropped. You do not have to ask. For other cases, like finished convictions, you may need to apply — the rules depend on the charge and how long it has been."

    en: [
      "Will my case be sealed on its own, or do I need to apply?",
      "How long do I have to wait before I can apply?",
      "Who can still see the sealed record, and when?",
      "Do I need a lawyer to seal it? (Free legal aid can often help.)"
