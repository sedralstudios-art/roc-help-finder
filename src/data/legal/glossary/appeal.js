  plainEnglish: {
    en: "Asking a higher court to review your case. You can appeal after you are found guilty at trial or after some guilty pleas. A higher court reads the record, listens to your lawyer, and decides if the trial judge made a mistake big enough to change the outcome. You do not get a new trial unless the higher court says so. Deadline: 30 days after sentencing to file a Notice of Appeal. This is a hard deadline. If you miss it, the appeal is usually dead. Free legal help is available through the appellate public defender."
