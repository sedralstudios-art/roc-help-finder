  plainEnglish: {
    en: "A short-term court order issued while the case is still being decided. It handles urgent matters that cannot wait for a final order. In a divorce or custody case, a temporary order can set parenting time, decide who lives in the marital home, set temporary child support and spousal support, and bar either party from selling marital assets. In a family-safety case, a temporary order of protection can issue on the day the petition is filed if the judge finds good cause. In a civil case, a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction can pause an action while the court considers the merits. Temporary orders stay in effect until the court issues a different order or the case ends. The standard for getting a temporary order is usually lower than the standard for the final order, but the requesting party still has to show some basis for the relief."
