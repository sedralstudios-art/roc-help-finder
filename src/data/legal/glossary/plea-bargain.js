// Descriptive term — not a statutory creation, but structured by CPL § 220.10
// (felony pleas) and § 340.20 (misdemeanor pleas). Over 95% of NY criminal
// cases resolve without trial, most through some form of plea agreement.

  context: {
    en: "You hear this when your lawyer and the prosecutor talk about ending the case without a trial. Most criminal cases in New York end this way — usually with you pleading guilty to a smaller charge in exchange for a lighter sentence."
  },

  plainEnglish: {
    en: "A deal between you (through your lawyer) and the prosecutor. You agree to plead guilty to a charge, and in exchange the prosecutor agrees to something — dropping other charges, reducing the charge to something smaller, or recommending a lighter sentence. The judge has the final say and can reject the deal. Before you accept, your lawyer will usually explain everything that will happen: the final charge, the sentence, the fine, the surcharge, and any effects on your record, job, license, or immigration status. Once the judge accepts your plea, it is very hard to take back."
