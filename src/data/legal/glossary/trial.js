  context: {
    en: "You hear this when a case did not end in a plea deal or a dismissal. It is where the facts get decided — either by a jury or by a judge alone. Most criminal cases in New York never go to trial. Most end with a plea."
  },

  plainEnglish: {
    en: "A formal hearing where the facts of the case are decided. The prosecutor has to prove every part of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. Most criminal trials in New York are jury trials — 12 jurors in felony cases, 6 in most misdemeanor cases. A defendant can also give up the jury and have a bench trial, where the judge alone decides. Each side gives opening statements, calls witnesses, shows evidence, and gives closing statements. Then the jury (or the judge, in a bench trial) returns a verdict of guilty or not guilty. A not-guilty verdict ends the case. A guilty verdict leads to sentencing."
