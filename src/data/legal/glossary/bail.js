// Glossary term: Bail
// Citation verified: NY CPL § 510.10. Note — 2020/2023 NY reforms removed
// cash bail for most misdemeanors and non-violent felonies. The "least
// restrictive" standard was replaced in the latest amendments with a
// "kind and degree of control or restriction necessary to reasonably
// assure return to court" standard. Volatility: medium — track yearly.

  plainEnglish: {
    en: "Money or a bond you pay so you can go home while your case is open. You must come back for every single court date. If you miss one, you can lose the money and the judge can put a warrant out for your arrest. In New York, judges cannot set cash bail for most small charges — they must use other ways to make sure you come back to court, like checking in or giving up your passport."
