    en: "The judge tells you what you are being charged with and gives you a copy of the paper. The judge also tells you your rights, including your right to a lawyer and your right to stay quiet. If you cannot afford a lawyer, the judge will assign one for free. Then the judge decides if you go home on your own, if you have to post bail, or if you stay in jail while the case moves forward."
