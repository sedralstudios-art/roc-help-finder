    en: "You see this on program applications and eligibility charts. It is the income number the government uses to decide who qualifies for help. Programs say things like '138% FPL' or '200% FPL' — that means 1.38 or 2 times the poverty line."

  plainEnglish: {
    en: "A dollar amount set by the federal government each year that represents the minimum income a household needs. Programs use it to set eligibility. For example, Medicaid in New York covers people up to 138% of FPL — meaning if you earn up to 1.38 times the poverty level, you qualify. For a single person in 2026, 100% FPL is about $15,060 per year. For a family of four, about $31,200. When a program says '200% FPL,' multiply those numbers by 2. The FPL goes up a little each year. Almost every public benefits program — SNAP, Medicaid, HEAP, WIC, childcare subsidy, school lunch — uses some version of the FPL to decide who gets in."
