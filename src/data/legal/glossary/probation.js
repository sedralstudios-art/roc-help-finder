  context: {
    en: "You hear this at sentencing. Probation is a way to avoid jail or prison, but you have to check in with a probation officer and follow a lot of rules. It is a real sentence — if you break the rules, you can be sent to jail."
  },

  plainEnglish: {
    en: "A sentence where you stay out of jail but have to check in with a probation officer and follow rules the court sets. Common rules: meet with your officer on time, no new arrests, drug tests, keep a job or go to school, pay what you owe, stay in the area, let your officer search your home. Probation is longer and stricter than a conditional discharge. In New York, a felony probation is usually 3 to 5 years. A Class A misdemeanor is 2 or 3 years. A Class B misdemeanor is 1 year. If you break the rules, the court can put you in jail for the rest of your sentence."
