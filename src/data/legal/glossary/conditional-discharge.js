  plainEnglish: {
    en: "The defendant is released without jail and without probation. The judge sets rules the person must follow for a set time — 1 year for a misdemeanor or violation, 3 years for a felony. Common rules include no new arrests, paying fines, doing community service, or finishing a class. Breaking a rule or getting arrested again can lead the judge to cancel the CD and re-sentence the person, including jail."
