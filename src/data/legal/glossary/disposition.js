// Glossary term: Disposition
// No single statutory definition — used throughout the CPL to mean
// "how the case ended." CPL Article 1 (general definitions) is the
// nearest anchor. Listed as a general-court-word because it comes up
// in every case type.

Common dispositions in New York: dismissed, ACD, found not guilty, guilty plea to a smaller charge, found guilty after trial, conditional discharge, probation, jail, prison, or violation. The disposition is what shows up on most background checks. If a case ended in the defendant's favor — dismissed, not guilty, or ACD — the record is sealed in most cases."
