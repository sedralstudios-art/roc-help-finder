  plainEnglish: {
    en: "A rule that keeps your benefits going at the same level while you wait for a fair hearing decision. It applies to SNAP, Temporary Assistance, Medicaid, and some other programs. To get aid continuing, you have to request the fair hearing before the date the change would take effect — that date is on the notice you got. If the notice was mailed late, you have 10 days from the postmark instead. Without this request, the change goes through even before the hearing. If you lose the hearing, you may have to pay back the benefits you received during the wait — so ask your legal aid about the trade-off."

      "How do I ask for the fair hearing AND for aid continuing in the same request?",
      "If I lose the hearing, how much could I have to pay back?",
      "Can I keep my benefits during the hearing for SNAP and Medicaid both?",
      "Does asking for a hearing hurt my current benefits in any other way?"
