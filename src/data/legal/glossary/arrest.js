    en: "The police take you into custody because they believe you committed an offense. The officer must tell you why, unless things are moving too fast (like if someone is fighting or running). After the arrest, you are brought to a local criminal court as soon as possible for arraignment. In some smaller cases you get a ticket to come back to court later — this is called an appearance ticket, and you are not held."
