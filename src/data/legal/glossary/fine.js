  context: {
    en: "You hear this at sentencing. A fine is money the judge orders you to pay to the state. It is different from restitution, which goes to the victim, and different from the mandatory surcharge, which is fixed by law."
  },

  plainEnglish: {
    en: "Money the court orders you to pay as part of your sentence. Fines in New York have maximum amounts set by law. For a Class A misdemeanor, up to $1,000. For a Class B misdemeanor, up to $500. For a violation, up to $250. For a felony, up to $5,000 or double what you gained from the crime — whichever is higher. Some drug and other special felonies have their own higher caps. Before setting the fine, the judge has to consider what you can actually afford, the impact on your family, and whether the amount fits the offense. The fine is separate from restitution (which goes to a victim) and from the mandatory surcharge (a fixed state fee)."
