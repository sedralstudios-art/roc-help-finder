    en: "You hear this when a case has been filed against someone and the court orders the police to go find them. It is different from a bench warrant. A bench warrant comes out after a missed court date. An arrest warrant usually comes out before anyone has been arrested or arraigned at all."

  plainEnglish: {
    en: "A paper signed by a judge that tells the police to arrest a specific person and bring them to court. Before issuing one, the judge looks at the charging paper and decides if there is enough reason to order the arrest. The goal of the warrant is to bring the person to arraignment — that is the first court date. An arrest warrant is different from a bench warrant. An arrest warrant starts the case. A bench warrant comes later, after a missed court date."
