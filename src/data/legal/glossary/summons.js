  context: {
    en: "You hear this when a court — not the police — sends you a paper ordering you to come to court for arraignment. It is one way a case starts without an arrest."
  },

  plainEnglish: {
    en: "A court paper telling you to come to court on a certain date for arraignment. A judge sends it after a case has been filed, usually when the judge thinks the person will show up on their own and does not need to be arrested. A summons is not the same as a desk appearance ticket. The police hand out DATs. The court issues summonses. If you get a summons and do not come to court on the date, the judge can issue a warrant for your arrest."
