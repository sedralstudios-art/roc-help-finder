    en: "You hear this after arraignment. The prosecutor has to give your lawyer copies of the evidence in the case — police reports, witness names, 911 recordings, body cam footage, and more. This used to be hidden until trial. Since 2020, the law requires it to come out fast, without your lawyer even asking."

    en: "The evidence the prosecutor has to share with your side. In New York since 2020, the prosecutor must turn over 21 kinds of things — police reports, witness names and contact info, 911 calls, videos, deals made with witnesses, and more — on a strict timeline. Your lawyer uses this to figure out how strong the case is and to decide whether to take a plea or go to trial. If the prosecutor misses the deadline or hides something, your lawyer can ask the judge to fix it or throw the case out."
