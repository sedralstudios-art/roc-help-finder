  context: {
    en: "You hear this when a probation officer files papers saying you broke a rule, got a new arrest, or missed something required. It is a separate court proceeding on top of your original case. You are entitled to a free lawyer."
  },

  plainEnglish: {
    en: "A claim that the probationer broke a rule of probation. Common reasons: missed a check-in, failed a drug test, new arrest, did not pay what was owed, or did not finish a required class. The court holds a hearing. The probationer can have a lawyer, see the evidence, question witnesses, and tell their side. The judge does not need proof 'beyond a reasonable doubt' — only 'more likely than not' that a rule was broken. If the judge finds a violation, three things can happen: probation keeps going, it changes (stricter rules), or it ends and the original jail sentence is imposed."
