  context: {
    en: "You hear this after a traffic ticket. Most tickets — speeding, running a red light, improper lane change — are traffic infractions. They are not crimes, even though they can cost money and points, and in rare cases a few days in jail."
  },

  plainEnglish: {
    en: "A ticket for breaking a traffic rule — speeding, running a stop sign, not signaling, and so on. Traffic infractions are not crimes in New York. They do not create a criminal record and do not affect whether a person can testify in court. But they come with real costs: a fine in the statutory range (NY VTL § 1800), DMV points, possible surcharges, and higher car insurance. If a driver gets 11 or more points in 18 months, the DMV can suspend the license. Some tickets are misdemeanors, not infractions — for example, some reckless driving or driving-while-suspended charges. The ticket itself shows the classification."
