  context: {
    en: "You hear this when a parent, guardian, or school is dealing with a child under 18 who is out of control — running away, skipping school, refusing to follow rules at home — but has not committed a crime. PINS is the non-criminal side of juvenile court."

  plainEnglish: {
    en: "A Family Court case for a child under 18 who is not under control and whose behavior is not a crime — like skipping school, running away, or not obeying a parent or guardian. Before anyone can file a PINS petition, the family has to meet with a probation officer to try services first. Only if those do not work can the case go to court. A judge can do a range of things: a warning, home-based services, living with a relative, or placement in a group or foster home for up to 18 months. PINS is different from Juvenile Delinquency — JD is for kids charged with something that would be a crime for an adult. PINS cases are for behavior that is not itself a crime."
