    en: "You hear this at arraignment. If you cannot afford to hire your own lawyer, the judge assigns one to you for free. In Monroe County, the office is usually the Monroe County Public Defender or an 18-B panel lawyer — both are free."

  plainEnglish: {
    en: "A lawyer the court gives you for free if you cannot pay for one. This is your right in every criminal case where jail is possible. In New York, each county has a plan: a Public Defender office, a Legal Aid group, or a panel of private lawyers (called '18-B' after the law). You still get a real lawyer — the same court rules, the same duty to you. You do not owe the lawyer money. You may have to fill out a short form about your income."
