In health care, a referral from the primary care doctor may be required before the patient can see a specialist, depending on the insurance plan. Medicaid managed care plans in New York often require referrals for specialists. In social services, a referral means an agency is connecting the client with a program that fits their needs — the staff may call ahead, give a name to ask for, or send the client's information (with permission). A referral is not a guarantee of service — the receiving program still does its own intake and eligibility check."
