  context: {
    en: "You hear this at sentencing if the case involved something taken, broken, or stolen. The judge orders you to pay the victim back for what they lost."
  },

  plainEnglish: {
    en: "Money the defendant pays to the victim of the crime — not to the court — to cover what the victim lost. It can include the value of stolen property, repair costs, medical bills, or lost wages. The judge decides the exact amount at sentencing. For most cases, restitution is capped by law (with separate caps for felonies, misdemeanors, and violations); the current statutory caps are in NY Penal Law § 60.27. The defendant can agree to a higher amount. Non-payment can lead the court to extend probation, garnish wages, or refer the balance to collections. Paying restitution does not bar a civil suit, but restitution paid usually counts against any civil award."

      "How much restitution is being asked for? How did they figure out the number?",
      "Can I see proof of the loss?",
      "Can I set up a payment plan I can afford?",
      "What happens if I can't pay?",
      "Does this go on my credit?"
